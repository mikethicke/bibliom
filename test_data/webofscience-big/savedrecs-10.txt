   knowledge
AB In this paper, we propose an ontology for the field of mechanical design that enable the sharing of mechanical design knowledge. In the process of ontology construction, meta-concepts in mechanical design field are extracted, relationships between the concepts are then defined, and finally knowledge is integrated based on the experience and inference of the designer. On top of that, the relationship between design concepts and the inference are described by OWL(Web Ontology Language) and stored into database. By doing this, the transferring and sharing of design information, and the pursuit of design solution can be made possible. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   Diagram; YAWL
AB Model transformations are frequently applied in model-driven development to bridge between languages on a different level of abstraction and formality. In This paper, we define a transformation from UML 2.0 Activity diagram(UML-AD for short) to YAWL, a formal workflow language that is able to capture all of the 20 workflow patterns reported in[1]. The transformation is mainly concerned on the control-flow aspects of UML-AD models. We illustrate the transformation challenges and present a suitable transformation algorithm. The benefit of the transformation is threefold. First, it clarifies the semantics of UML-AD via a mapping to YAWL. Second, the deployment of UML-AD business process models as workflows is simplified. Third, UML-AD models can be analyzed with YAWL veri. cation tools. a (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Business process model plays an important role in model-driven development. When dealing with complex business process models, sometimes it is not easy to determine whether a process model contains any errors. The concepts such as cancellation and OR-joins occur naturally in business scenarios but the presence of these features in process models poses new challenges for veri. cation. We take on the challenge of finding new veri. cation techniques for business process models with cancellation regions and OR-joins. The proposed approach relies on anti-patterns matching. This paper verificate business process models by detecting errors illustrated by anti-patterns in the model. First we define some anti-patterns which frequently occur in business process models. We present these techniques in the context of business process modeling language YAWL that provides direct support for all the 20 control-flow patterns reported in [1]. We have implemented a diagnostic tool based on anti-pattern detecting. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Many problems exist in processing experimental aircraft vibration (temperature, humidity) data and generating the intermediate calculations during the construction of airplane environment resource database, such as the need to deal with both structural and non-structural data, weak capacity of the client browser for data processing and massive network data transferring etc. To solve the above problems, some strategies on tuning and optimization performance of database are employed base on Oracle11g, which include data storage structure tuning, the memory configuration of the server, the disk I/O tuning and SQL statement tuning. The experimental results show that the performance of airplane environment resource database is enhanced about 80% compared with the database developed in the initial demonstration and validation phase. The application of new optimization strategies to the database construction can lay a sound foundation for finishing building airplane environment resource database.

The algorithm set matrix to record the exploring experiences and exploring results of the individual parent. The algorithm uses these records to guide the generation of offspring. And thus you can adaptively select the dimension to mutate and exploring radius. In addition, to improve the algorithm accuracy, the algorithm raises the best opportunities by using super-variation operator. In the simulation test, compared with similar algorithms, the results show that EABME has fast convergence speed and optimum performance of global convergence. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The method centers about task, and generalizes the conceptual model development process to the following three steps: describing system structure and its implementation procedure, decomposing task and modeling behavior. After analyzing the method's reusability, its good impact for raising the model's reusability can be proved. Thereby, the method can be applied in the conceptual model's development of simulation system (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Fan is widely used in the industrial process, but fan usually have complicated nonlinear characteristics. The stronger degree of nonlinearity is, the bigger deviation between the model and actual process is. The performance of conventional linear controller will be significantly stepped down with enhanced nonlinearity of the controlled process. Many practical applications need the model of fan to be linearized. And the result is scribed in the paper which adopts the theory of linearization clan to deal with the relationships of the flow and pressure on nonlinear fan model. First, fan is given as a nonlinear object, and then is processed by using the linearization clan method, to get a series of linear models segments. These linear models are superimposed to describe the nonlinear model. Simulation results show the method of linearization clan can approximately describe the nonlinear system of fan, and it has good operability and value of application.

ID DESIGN
AB Pump is main equipment in air conditioning systems and used widely, but its energy consumption is great. In order to improve energy efficiency, using pump controlled by frequency-conversion technology is an effective method. In this paper, the working principle and control method of variable frequency pump is described in detail, and gives a comparison between variable frequency control and traditional control about energy saving effect. Because traditional PID controller can be hard to get good control performance in pump control, this paper presents a control method using fuzzy logic controller to achieve frequency conversion and constant pressure water supply. The controlled variable is obtained by fuzzy control table. The system has energy-saving, security, and stable water pressure, etc. Simulation results show that the proposed controller not only have good robustness, but also have good dynamic and static performance.

AB In order to solve the problem of direct torque control (DTC) for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) related to the flux and the torque ripple and the uncertainty of switching frequency, A novel direct torque control system based on space vector modulation(SVM-DTC) for permanent magnet synchronous motor was proposed. In this method flux and torque are controlled through stator voltage components in stator flux linkage coordinate axes and space vector modulation is used to control inverters. Therefore, the errors of torque and flux linkage could be compensated accura(a)tely. The whole system has only one easily adjustable PI adjuster and needs no high for hardware and easy for realize. The simulation results verify the feasibility of this method, reduction of the flux and the torque ripple, and the good performance of DTC. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE hybird MAC; cross-layer; middle and high rate sensor networks
AB of service (QoS) requirements for different transmission rate, energy efficiency is a very critical issue to prolong the networks lifetime, an effective and fare MAC is necessary. A hybrid MAC protocol based on cross-layer optimization, called RHMAC (Rate-adaptive Hybrid Medium Access Control) for middle and high rate sensor networks is proposed in this paper. RHMAC combines the strengths of both CSMA and TDMA at the same time offsetting their weaknesses. Like CSMA, RHMAC achieves high channel utilization and low latency under low data rate. Like TDMA, achieves high channel utilization and fair under middle and high rate and reduces collision among two-hop neighbors at a low cost. RHMAC can switch between CSMA and TDMA depending on date rate automatically. Simulation result shows that RHMAC achieves much higher throughput and energy efficiency than other traditional hybrid MAC such as BMAC in multi-hop in middle and high rate sensor networks.

AB Although the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm has been widely used for finding maximum likelihood estimation of parameters in probabilistic models, it has the problem of trapping by local maxima. To overcome this problem, the deterministic annealing EM (DAEM) algorithm was once proposed and had achieved better performance than EM algorithm, but it is not very effective at avoiding local maxima. In this paper, a solution is proposed by integrating GA and DAEM into one procedure to further improve the solution quality. The population based search of genetic algorithm will produce different solutions and thus can increase the search space of DAEM. Therefore, the proposed algorithm will reach better solution than just using DAEM. The algorithm retains the property of DAEM and gets the better solution by genetic operation. Experiment results on Gaussian mixture model parameter estimation demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve better performance. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The traditional artificial annotation of insect images is time-consuming and laborious. Moreover, for subjective factors, the results are always not uniform, which results in unsatisfactory results of the subsequent retrieval of insect images. So in this paper, a new method of image annotation was proposed, based on texture feature of insect images. First it introduced the feature extraction of the objects from insects images; And then elaborated on the implementation process of insects image classification and semantic annotation used SVM support vector machine method; Finally, the experimental results were offered which showed that the method not only could make up the shortage of the traditional manual image annotation of insects by entomologist, but also able to provide more real-time, accurate semantic annotations on insect images.

This method is used to stabilize unstable periodic orbits embedded in high-dimensional chaotic attractors by small parameters' perturbations. We demonstrate its operation in gear system using different combinations and numbers of control parameters. Results show that this contribution provides a more effective unstable periodic orbit stabilization than the classical single-parameter method, and the method uses smaller values of accessible control parameter than the ones provided the single parameter method.

AB In this paper, we apply Hough transform circle detection method to solve the problem of initial points of K-Means clustering algorithm. With the RGB values of the four detected circle centre points and a background point, all pixels in the image are clustered into 5 groups. In this way, the convergence and accuracy of K-Means algorithm can be greatly improved. Then a 12 dimension vector can be obtained which will be used for the recognition process. In the end, we give an example of acetaldehyde to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The safe transportation of the long distance gas transmission pipeline needs real-time state monitoring and fault diagnosis. But, there are often a lot of noises and disturbances in the acquired pressure and flow of signal because of the existence of various interferences. Based on determining fault diagnosis system composition of long distance pipeline, the data sampling frequency and advance filtering method were analyzed. In view of the signal data quantity size of the pressure and flow, based on recursive average filtering and median filtering principles, the signal hybrid filter processing method was proposed. And the application examples show the effectiveness of this method. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID 5-AXIS MACHINE-TOOLS; ERRORS; ROBOT
AB In order to realize precise laser welding of the aerospace thin sheet parts, it is necessary to model the 3-D butt joint accurately. Due to narrow seam gap and little misalignment of the butt joint, it is difficult to extract all the feature information such as 3-D seam position, surface normal and gap width in a lump by traditional methods or sensors. Furthermore, these feature information acquired by laser vision sensor are just expressed in local measuring coordinate system, which can't be used for global modeling directly. In this paper, a mathematical modeling method based on the kinematic model of the laser welding & measuring machine tool was proposed. The machine tool's form-shaping function matrix was derived according to the homogeneous coordinate transformation matrix and the kinematic parameters. By using this form-shaping function matrix, the measured data could be converted into global data stably and accurately. Through B-spline surface fitting, the 3-D butt joint's mathematical model including all the feature information was established.

AB As the rapid development of the Web, automatic summarization has become more and more important for handling the huge amount of text information in the Web. This paper proposes an automatic summarization method based on compound-word recognition and keyword extraction, called CASKE. CASKE firstly recognizes the compound-words in a document, labels P.O.S. and revises word segmentation. Then, it extracts keywords, and calculates sentence weights by keyword weights. Finally it selects with proportion the sentences with large weights to construct summary. The generated summary has good continuity and is readable. Experiment results show that the generated summaries are similar with manual reference summaries, achieving 68.31% Precision and 66.72% Recall in average. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB At present, the research vehicle from the network is still in the initial stage, which is mainly in some of the key agreements and simulation theory. MAC protocol is one of the key issues. In this paper, combined with Frequency Division Multiple Access theory on the classic FAMA-NCS protocol, we transform control packets and data packets in different frequency groups, respectively, for transmission of data packets using 17 frequency groups, the control group using two frequency groups. This improvement can effectively reduce the conflicts between the different hosts of the CTS packets, and it can also reduce the problem of false host. This paper also present the proto-VANET based on improved FAMA-NAC protocol and AODV protocol to verify the reliability of improvement. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB According to the observation vector acquired by Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) and Active Pixel Sensor (APS) star tracker for three-axis stabilization micro-satellite, an attitude estimation using spherical simplex unscented transformation Kalman filtering (SSUKF) based on modified Rodrigues parameters (MRPs) was presented. The model was implemented, in which the sampling points were decreased through spherical simplex unscented transformation (SSUT) while the filter performance was guaranteed and the computation was reduced through attitude of satellite described by MRPs. The simulation results of some micro-satellite showed that this algorithm could insure accuracy, fast convergence and high robustness with high computation efficiency, which was suitable for the attitude estimation of micro-satellite.

ID SENSITIVE AREAS
AB Since Land Use Planning's (LUP) implement will have impact on local ecological environment, the environmental assessment of LUP (LUPEA) is essential. This article explored the feasibility and method of LUPEA based on the environmental sensitive analysis study under the support of remote-sensing (RS) technique and Geographic Information System (GIS) and had assessed the Zoucheng County Land Use Overall Planning Environmental Impact using the method above.
   Firstly, after the analysis of the local environment status in quo, the environmental individual factors of Zoucheng County were determined, which included soil erosion, biodiversity, water quality, land subside and drain basin pollution. Secondly, the drainage area, elevation hierarchical map and slope distributing map were extracted with the aids of SRTM3 data. After that, we constructed the contaminant burdening indices including chemical oxygen demand (COD) and waste water on the basis of local drainage area to measure drain basin pollution individual factors. Thirdly, the vegetation feature and land use/cover information were also extracted using LandSat TM image based on the supervised classification and man-machine interaction interpretation method. Fourthly, with groundwater, nature reserve, coal mining caving in risk thematic information and other data including extracted information above, the Environmental Assessment Database System was set up in GIS environment. After the overall evaluation of environment status, the comprehensive assessment map of Zoucheng county environment was acquired and was overlapped by the land use overall planning map subsequently.
   With the analysis of the environmental assessment and land use overall planning data, several conclusions were drawn as follows:
   High sensitive areas are mostly located on the big slope and areas and mountains apt to lose water and soil; moderate ones, on groundwater resources, large contribution water body, nature reserve and coal mining caving in risk area; and low ones, on natural or manmade woods and relatively severe polluted basins.
   Burdening contaminant of local drainage area is an important factor in industrial distribution layout.
   Land use overall planning scheme of Zoucheng County was feasible in environment respect in first approximation.
   It is of great significance to assess the LUP using RS and GIS Technology. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Selection and/or peer-review under responsibility of ICEES 2011 International Conference on Energy and Environmental Science.

ID CARBON-DIOXIDE; STORAGE
AB In order to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change, CO2 captured from carbon emitters like coal-fired power plants may be stored in deep saline aquifers. This action may cause pressure changes, which affect subsurface volumes. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the pressure changes during CO2 sequestration in CO2 storage formation embedded in a sequence of aquifers and aquitard of Qianjiang depression area in China. In order to demonstrate the transient pressure, we have conducted TOUGH2 modeling of CO2 injection into closed formations of different thicknesses assuming impermeable boundaries. A 2-D radially symmetric model was developed to represent a CO2 storage site in the Qianjiang depression area. The storage formation into which CO2 was injected is 120 m thick and located at a depth of about 1380m below the ground surface. The CO2 injection thickness was 15m from the bottom of the storage formation. Carbon dioxide was injected into a zone of 77 m radial extent representing a few distributed wells. Injection occurs at an annual rate of 2.488 * 10 (7) tonnes of CO2 representing 16 times the CO2 rate captured from a medium-size-coal-fired power plant. The simulation runs cover a time period of 100 years altogether, comprising the 30-year injection period and a 70-year post-injection period. The pressure buildup results after one year never attains 50% of initial pressure (maximum tolerable pressure buildup). Our simulation results indicate that interlayer pressure propagation through a sequence of aquitard/aquifer will not affect the top aquifer. Moderate pressure increases occur in top aquifer only in case when pore compressibility was reduced by one order of magnitude.

AB Using the fixed bed (phi=72mm) packing with micro glass beads to simulate a small sack in the catalyst-bundles. A dispersion model was established at the stable state point source tracing condition, and it's analytic and numerical solution were obtained. The stable state point source tracer technique and reducing pressure sampling were used to measure the concentration profile of tracer under different liquid flow rate and different height of fixed bed. The results indicated that the coefficient of radial diffusion decreased with the increasing of the packing height, on the contrary the coefficient of radial diffusion increased with the increasing of the liquid flow rate and the diameter of the micro beads. The influence of axial diffusion coefficient on the radial diffusion coefficient was also discussed and the relationship between Per with ln(Re) was obtained by data regression.

The weight problem has been modified by adopting the PCA, which make the weight value more objective. From quantitative assessment, the water shortage risk of Beijing stays high level from 2001 to 2008 and the unique channel for risk reduction is to improve the water saving technologies and increasing the sewage treatment rate.

AB The research focuses on applications of ecological protections in the desert route - the Sanggendalai similar to Gongzhugeng highway crossing Otindag Sandy land. Some protective measures are brought forward, as sand barriers of low upright grid and sand barriers of tall upright grid. Furthermore, these sand barriers and their sand breaking effectiveness like soil improvement, vegetation recovery etc are traced by means of field survey. Namely, (1) the low upright sand barriers have raised surface roughness up to 5.64cm, and wind velocity at the near surface (0.25m) within sand barrier reduces to 2.39m/s from previous 6.5m/s, which means the surface windproof efficiency averages to 63.1%; the near surface wind velocity within the high upright sand barrier goes down to 2.7m/s from 6.5m/s, its wind proof efficiency gains 58.5%. (2) Compared to sand drifting area, the bulk density of soil inside the low and high upright barriers drops by 14.2%, soil porosity rises by 16% and soil water content upward by 77.8% at peak. The same to the increase of soil organic matter, hydrolysable nitrogen, available P content, available K content etc, that illuminate amelioration of local soil because of various sand barriers.

AB Based on the polyclonal antibodies (pAbs), an indirect competitive ELISA (icELISA) has been developed for the determination of Ractopamine (Rac) residue in swine and cattle. Mixed anhydride method was employed to synthesize the artificial antigen of Rac-BSA and coating antigen of Rac-OVA; and two female New Zealand white rabbits were used to produce anti-Rac pAb. By the square matrix titration, the icELISA method was developed. The linear range was from 0.006 to 30 ng/mL, with LOD and IC50 value of 0.003 ng/ mL and 0.44 ng/mL, respectively. Except for a moderate cross-reactivity (34.5%) to Dobutamine, negligible cross-reactivity to the other compounds was observed. After optimization, 1:10 dilution in swine muscle and 1:20 dilution in cattle muscle produced the satisfactory B0 and IC50 values, respectively. When applied in real sample tests, the correlation coefficients (R2) of the concentration spiked and concentration determined were 0.9411 in swine and 0.9623 in cattle. Therefore, this assay has the potential for the rapid screening of Rac residue in food. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Based on the self-purification characteristics of wastewater in highway tunneling, this paper analyzed the causes and mechanism of its formation. It is found that there are some components of coagulants in protecting gunite for wastewater treatment. From experimental study, a method of treating wastewater in tunneling with joint use of cement and aluminum sulfate is put forward. The method is especially effective in the treatment of toxic nitrobenzene, with a removal rate as high as 60%. This method is suitable for highway and railway construction due to its characteristics of existence of many construction spots and convenience of material so that it has a fairly good application prospect.

AB Through the testing and analysis of contaminants in wastewater before and after blasting in highway tunnel construction, it has been found that the major overproof indexes are its pH and SS, besides some tiny amount of toxic substances. Tests show that this type of wastewater has a phenomenon of self purification, which comes from the use of shot concrete. This phenomenon was further verified in experiments. Hence the research is helpful for the study on the treatment techniques of wastewater in tunneling. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The cultivation of aerobic granular sludge with the capacity of removing phosphorus was performed in the Sequencing Batch Reactor(SBR) using conventional flocculent activated sludge as seeding sludge and synthetic municipal wastewater. The results showed that the aerobic granular sludge had the good settling-ability, the high biomass retention and the regular structure with a diameter of 1.0 to 2.0mm, SVI of which was 20 similar to 22mL/g. Moreover, the effect of shear stress on granulation, morphology and bioactive of granules were all investigated. The results showed that within the range of 0.12 similar to 0.151N/m(2) of shear stress, the lager the shear stress was, the denser, the more regular and the more bioactive of granules was. When shear stress is between 0.12 and0.184N/m(2), the larger the shear stress was, the faster the sludge granulation process and the larger the cultivated granular sludge size was. However, excessive shear force (0.220N/m(2)) would slow down the process of sludge granulation and the size of cultivated sludge particles would become smaller. In addition, Aerobic granular sludge which had the capacity of removing nitrogen and phosphorus simultaneously was successfully induced by gradually increasing ammonia nitrogen concentration in the influent. The removal efficiencies of the aerobic granular sludge on TN and PO4-P were 89.8% and 94.5%, respectively. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The 170 releves, out of a field sampling conducted in protected areas of Northern Togo, were subjected to a floristic analysis in order to study the status of the remnant flora and plant diversity and to determine the distribution of life forms and phytogeographic types. 274 plants species, grouped in 63 families were recorded, among which six families proved to be well represented in this region. The Sudano-Zambesian species followed by Pan-Tropical and Guineo-Congolian were the most frequent phytogeographic types while the phanerophytes, especially micro-phanerophytes and nano-phanerophytes, were the most represented life forms.

AB Through establishing the rat model of exercise-induced fatigue, we detected the distribution and expression of calcineurin (CaN) in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and explored the role of CaN in fatigue-induced learning and memory disorder. Adult male SD rats were randomly divided into control group and fatigue group. Rats in fatigue group exercised to exhaust on treadmill for 7 days, and those in control group didn't exercise. Step-through test was used to detect the changes of learning and memory ability. Immunohistochemistry was used to observe the distribution and expression of CaN in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. CaN-immunoreactive cells were also countered. The results indicated that rats with exercise-induced fatigue showed learning and memory disorder. In the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of rats in the fatigue group, the expressions of CaN increased obviously compared with that of the control group (P<0.05). The present results suggest that the learning and memory disorder induced by fatigue might relate to the changes of the expression of CaN in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus.

AB This paper describes the training, validation and application of recurrent neural network (RNN) models to computing the total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and dissolved oxygen (DO) at three different sites in Gonghu Bay of Lake Taihu during the period of water diversion. The input parameters of Elman's RNN were selected by means of the principal component analysis (PCA). Sequentially, the conceptual models for Elman's RNN of different simulated parameters were established and the Elman models were trained and validated on daily data set. The values of TN, TP and DO computed by the models were closely related to their respective values measured at the three sites. The results show that the PCA can efficiently ascertain appropriate input parameters for Elman's RNN and the Elman's RNN can precisely compute and forecast the water quality parameters during the period of water diversion.

AB 1 degrees C is normally considered as an extreme chilling stress temperature and will cause severe chilling injury to chilling-sensitive plants. Chilling acclimation of chilling-sensitive plants was usually achieved by exposure to around or above the threshold chilling temperature (about 10 degrees C or 15 degrees C) for several days. In our present work, a cold-shock pretreatment at 1 degrees C for 4 h, followed by a 6-h recovery at 26.5 degrees C, significantly enhanced survival rate of maize seedlings, mitigated electrolyte leakage of primary roots and alleviated vitality loss of mesocotyls under severe chilling stress at 1 degrees C, indicating that short-term cold-shock could induce chilling tolerance of maize seedlings. The cold-shock pretreatment brought out an endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) peak, enhanced the activities of five antioxidant enzymes guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in maize mesocotyls and remained significantly higher activities of these five antioxidant enzymes after chilling stress. These results imply that antioxidant systems play a pivotal role in the cold-shock-induced chilling tolerance of maize seedlings, and H2O2 may be involved in signaling and triggering of this cold-shock-induced chilling tolerance through the mobilization of antioxidant systems.

AB This paper evaluates the effects of a groundfire on the radial growth of fire tolerance species Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) trees growing in the Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve which occurred more than 90 years. The study material includes damaged and undamaged sample trees approximately with the same age. The trees are growing in close vicinity to each other and are subject to the same climatic conditions. The study material is rather homogenous and allowing analysis of the long-term effects of ground fire on the growth of important tree species. Two tree-ring chronologies from 25 fire-damaged and 24 undamaged trees were analyzed. The results showed that temperature and precipitation during the previous winter had a significant effect on the mean annual radial growth of both groups. Trees which had been damaged by an old fire were more sensitive to the negative effect of high summer temperatures and to the positive effect of high spring temperatures than the undamaged group. In contrast to previous studies, their growth was also considerably more affected by competition than the growth of the undamaged individuals. The study material is rather homogenous and probably unique, allowing such a temporal and spatial analysis of the long-term effects of a ground fire on the growth of an important tree species in a northern temperate forest.

AB Photocatalytic removal of phenol was studied using the photocatalyst poly(fluorine-co-bithiophene) (PFB)/TiO2 under visible light. After two hours irradiation with a three watts GaN LEDs (light emitting diode) cluster, about 75% removal of phenol. the degradation reaction showed the firs-order behavior and the reaction rate constants (k) of PFB/TiO2 was calculated to be 0.0169 min(-1). Diffuse reflectance spectra showed that the absorbance range of PFB/TiO2 was expanded from 387 nm (TiO2) to above 500 nm. Photoluminescent spectra and photoluminescent quantum efficiency indicated that electrons were transferred from PFB to the conduction band of TiO2. The surface modification using PFB did not decrease the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 under the UV light irradiation. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background Obesity results from an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, which leads to a pathological accumulation of adipose tissue, but the underlying mechanism at gene level is far from being elucidated.
   Methods Pig primary adipocytes were cultured in vitro and the expression of HSL was detected by real-time PCR.
   Results The high concentrations of glucose group significantly cut down the mRNA expression of HSL (P<0.01) rather than in the others.
   Conclusion Our results provide significant data for that confirm an association between different glucose level and HSL expression in preadipocytes. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the analysis model of control cost per-unit, the cost of air pollution control was accounted in Xi'an from 2000 to 2007 in this paper. Based on the accounting results, the gross amount and the structure of control cost were analyzed. Environmental economic indicators were used in analytical process, such as the virtual control cost, the index of pollution control cost deduction from GDP and the environmentally adjusted domestic product. The results showed that the key control pollutants are smoke and SO2. The ratio of the virtual control cost to actual control cost showed that the air pollution control expenditure remains inadequate, so the investment for air pollution control should be increased progressively. The index of pollution control cost deduction from GDP in air pollution was less than the national average. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB High-throughput proteomics experiments produce large amounts of MS/MS data, but many are of too low quality to be utilized. Filtering out the low quality MS/MS spectra is one of the strategies to increase computational speed of database searching. We investigate the variables proposed in previous literatures, and collect 63 features for our study, including 8 new variables proposed in this paper. MRMR is used to select important variable set for 4 kinds of mass spectrometer platforms: Thermo LTQ-FT, LTQ LCQ, and Waters/Micromass QTOF. A Support Vector Machine based method is used to assess the quality of MS/MS spectra. Datasets from different mass spectrometers are applied to test the accuracy of our method. In order to prove the capability of our method, we compare it with msmsEval on the test datasets, and the results show that our method achieves higher accuracy and better performance than msmsEval. The programs can be obtained from the authors by request. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Synchronization of electrically coupled chaotic neuronal networks with various topologies is explored in this paper. A general synchronization condition of chaotic neuronal network is obtained by using Master Stability Function method first. Then the condition is applied in chain, ring, star and global coupling networks respectively, while numerical simulations are also performed to check the effectiveness of the condition. It is shown that Master Stability Function method is effective for determining synchronization condition of diffusively coupled neuronal networks and networks with various topologies have different synchronization abilities, which means the speed of information circulation varies a lot in different types of neuronal networks in human brain.

AB Synchronization of coupled neurons is thought to be important for information communication in neuronal systems. In this paper, phase synchronization of an electrically coupled small-world neuronal network is explored. A small-world Hindmarsh-Rose neuronal network is set up first and then the effects of various network parameters and the heterogeneity of the network on phase synchronization are discussed with some biological explanations. It is demonstrated that the necessary coupling strengths for phase synchronization decrease with the increase of the number of neurons, the degree of nodes and the connection density, and the network heterogeneity has an adverse effect on the synchronizability of the neuronal network.

AB In this paper, we propose a method for studying synchronization in two coupled Fitzhugh-Nagumo(FHN) neurons without or with time delay. Some sufficient conditions for synchronization in the coupled FHN neurons without or with time delay are obtained by an untied method. We avoid using the Lyapuonv functional method to deal with synchronization problem in delay differential system. Simulation results illustrate our analysis. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB It is presented a new approach for the identification of RNA molecules functional domains. Based on the use of weakly self-affine functions, Our method allows to segmenting of the signal into parts and gives segmentation marks which are multifractally homogeneous. It is found that the method can be applied to estimate multifractal spectra for identification of tmRNA functional domains. In this application, The signal contains 1480 samples, we set sigma(j) = j(2) and j(0) = 6 and used the Daubechies 12 wavelet, a threshold of epsilon = 8 yields a modeling with three WSA functions, where 75% of the coefficients are processed. Our result show that tmRNA functional domains identification, the original signal and the model are visually almost indistinguishable. The segmentation is relevant since the marks almost perfectly coincide with the three functional domains of tmRNA secondary structure. The slight discrepancy between the position of the segmentation marks and the exact location of the units is due to the fact that, in the current implementation, the marks are restricted to be on dyadic points.

AB In order to understand the structure and function of L-FABP gene, reveal the effect on the fatty acid binding in goat, and find the molecule marker correlated with meat traits, the cDNA of L-FABP gene was cloned and sequenced from liver of goat by T-A clone techniques. The structure and function of L-FABP were analyzed by bioinformatics, and the gene expression profile in different tissues was examined by real-time PCR. The results showed that the full sequence of L-FABP cDNA is 405 bp, containing 384 bp coding region (CDS) encoding 127 amino acids. The secondary structure of the protein was mainly alpha-helixes, extended strands and beta-turns structure. The deduced amino acid sequence of L-FABP shared significant identity with the L-FABP from other mammals. The phylogenic tree based on L-FABP protein sequence was detected the closest relationship between cattle and pig. A predicted 3D model was constructed by homology modeling.

AB Synchronization in two coupled Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) neurons is considered. Whether the coupling forms between the two neurons are linear or not, synchronization in the two neurons always means the decrease of the Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the chaotic attractor of the neural system. According to frequency analysis, the two coupled HR neurons can change the output of the significance of the information and forms by adjusting coupling strength and form between them.

ID FUNCTIONAL MELATONIN RECEPTORS
AB Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine), an indole hormone, regulates various biological functions through three different receptor subtypes (Mel-1a, Mel-1b, and Mel-1c), acting through melatonin receptors, is involved in numerous physiological processes including circadian entrainment, blood pressure regulation, oncogenesis, retinal physiology, seasonal reproduction, ovarian physiology, and most recently in inducing osteoblast differentiation. The MT1 (or Mel1A or MTNR1A) and MT2 (or Mel1B or MTNR1B) receptor subtypes are present in humans and other mammals, while an additional melatonin receptor subtype MT3 (or Mel1C or MTNR1C) has been identified in amphibia and birds. The Mel-1a and Mel-1b receptor subtypes are present in humans and other mammals, while an additional melatonin receptor subtype Mel-1c has been identified in amphibia and birds. The Mel-1a subtype is present in the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland and the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. In order to understand the structure and function of Mel1A gene, in this study, we sequenced Mel1A gene, did some bioinformatic and characteristics analysis of its product. The results showed that the full CDS sequence of Mel1A is 1062 bp, encoding 353 amino acids. The secondary structure of the protein was mainly a-helixes, extended strands, random coil and beta-turns structure. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A melatonin receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) which binds melatonin. Three types of melatonin receptor have been cloned. The MT1 (or Mel1A or MTNR1A) and MT2 (or Mel1B or MTNR1B) receptor subtypes are present in humans and other mammals, while an additional melatonin receptor subtype MT3 (or Mel1C or MTNR1C) has been identified in amphibia and birds. The hormone melatonin is secreted primarily from the pineal gland, with highest levels occurring during the dark period of a circadian cycle. This hormone, through an action in the brain, appears to be involved in the regulation of various neural and endocrine processes that are cued by the daily change in photoperiod. This article reviews the research progress on melatonin receptor in poultry. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The objective of this study was to infer phylogenetic relationships among 8 sequenced mitochondrial genomes within Tephritidae of Diptera. According to conserved (C) / variable (V) sites ratio test, we combined all 13 mtDNA protein coding genes (PCGs) into a single data set for use in determining phylogeny. The same gene regions of Pteronarcys princes, Lucilia sericata and Drosophila yakuba were used as outgroup. When MP and ML analysis were applied to the combined data set, they gave two fairly similar trees. Accorded with all previous morphological and molecular evidence, the monophyly of family Tephritidae was strongly recovered in our result. Our data set led to a likelihood tree in which B. dorsalis and B. papayae was provided relative closely relationship meanwhile B. carambolae formed a clade basal to them. This result agreed with Zhang et al. (2010) and Nadi et al. (2010). (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Smart living space is a new theory which is based in the context of pervasive computing and the theory of smart space. Currently there is no research in this area, but some of the best smart space theory&rearch can direct reference. Since the smart living space has a wide range of concept, we choose from the smart community to study the smart living space and take smart space as a breakthrough point and the smart space-related technologies can be used to build the smart living space. At last we take the smart classroom of TsingHua university as an example of the specific application. And make a conclusion that the research on smart living space is reality available but also faces many challenges and the socio-technical background of smart living space will be the future research emphasis.

AB The testing experiments to healthy poplar logs samplings whose diameter scopes were in 5-11cm and the length respectively were 10cm and 30cm were conducted by using Arbotom stress wave testing instrument and universal mechanics testing machine. The relationships between dynamic modulus of elasticity of stress wave and compression and bending properties were all studied in the poplar logs samplings. The results indicated that, in the 30cm poplar log samplings, the dynamic modulus of elasticity of stress wave had good linear correlation with the four indexes. However, in the 10cm samplings, the situation was a little different and the dynamic modulus of elasticity didn't have good linear correlation with MOE in compression parallel to grain and compression strength.

AB This paper introduces the granular computing thought and method into evolutionary algorithm. Take the solving process of the evolutionary algorithm as an information system; adopt the equivalent relation to divide the solution space and objective function, form subspace granule or objective function granule. On this basis, we proposed the conception of granularity fitness landscape. We use the methods of binary granular computing to find the relation between subspace granule and objective function granule, express the dependency of objective function to the individuals at macroscopic. Take this as foundation to carry out the mutation operator what was direct by granular fitness landscape, this operator can improve the convergence rate of the evolutionary algorithm remarkable.

AB Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network is essential to understand the fundamental processes governing cell biology. It is well known that document classification systems are potential to accelerate the curation process by retrieving PPI-related documents. However, it is usually a case that there is an imbalanced two class data set on text classification. Learning from imbalanced data sets is an important challenge to the machine learning community. In this paper, we compare the performance of several document classifiers on one PPI document set and vary the size of the number of positives and the ratio of the number of positives to the number of negatives on training set and testing set in the experiment. Through the experiment, we try to find what kind of classification algorithm is suitable for imbalanced PPI document classification. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The data of meat freshness classification based on the TVB-N content, total bacterial count, pH value and sensory scores of meat samples in decompression storeroom were reported in this paper. The experiments showed that any single physicochemical and sensory properties could not reflect the freshness of meat sample exactly. Therefore SVM was introduced to train the experimental data and built the model to predict the meat freshness. The results indicated that the obtained model could achieve high classification accuracy after the parameters were optimized by coarse and fine search. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB There exsits generally the phenomenon about ultraweak photon emission from biological system in natural world. It was known that superweak luminescence exists in all animals and plants. The luminescence shows the important information of metabolism and energy transformation of the living biological organism. This passage did some research of rapeseeds' ultraweak luminescence based on nondestrucive testing. The experiment showed that luminescence intensity increased with the augment of mass, but the increase of luminescence intensity was not obvious when mass was augmented to a certain degree. It was nonlinear domino effect. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A heterologous indirect competitive ELISA (icELISA) format has been developed for the determination of enrofloxacin (ENR) residues in poultry. For this purpose, carbodiimide active ester method was employed to synthesize the artificial antigen of ENR-BSA while mixed-anhydride technique was used to synthesize the coating antigen of ENR-OVA, to pursue the heterologous sensitivity. By the square matrix titration, the icELISA method was developed for the quantitative detection of ENR, based on the pAb. The Linear range was from 0.02 to 86.3 ng/mL, with LOD and IC50 value of 0.8 ng/mL and 0.01 ng/mL, respectively. After optimization, 5% of NaOH was used in the assay buffer and this ELISA system can tolerate methanol not higher than 30%. Of all the cross-reacting analogues, this assay exhibited a high cross-reactivity to Ciprofloxacin (83%), Pefloxacin (67%), Danofloxacin (63%), Sarafloxacin (59%), and Norfloxacin (49%). The correlation coefficients (R-2) between concentration spiked and concentration determined were 0.9975 in chicken muscle and 0.9959 in duck muscle, respectively. Therefore, this assay has the potential to be incorporated into a quantitative monitoring program for the rapid screening of ENR residue in poultry tissues. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The debate on which exponent was correct, -3/2 or -4/3, was still a puzzled question in population self-thinning. To unify these two exponents, a new model linking population spatial distribution and the individual growth was provided here. Based on the fact that space was occupied by individuals, we found that the basic structure of even-aged and mono-specific plant population was an equilateral hexagon, which was constituted of seven individuals. Furthermore, the individual volume, described with integration method, was proved to be proportional to power of length. In the fractal geometry opinion, the dimension of the section was fractal and varied between 1 and 2. So the exponent of self-thinning power law was a real number between -1 and -3/2. We concluded that -4/3 power law was not universal in self-thinning process, but a transient value in the range of -1 and -3/2. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Xylanase is the name given to a class of enzymes which degrade the linear polysaccharide beta-1,4-xylan into xylose. Xylan is one of the most abundant polysaccharides existing in nature. It consists of a backbone of beta-1,4-linked d-xylose, usually with branches of alpha-1,3-linked L-arabinose and alpha-1,2-linked D-glucopyranose. To find out whether xylanase plays important roles in banana fruit softening, the enzyme activities in peel and pulp, fruit firmness, respiration rate and ethylene release rate were assayed during banana softening. The results showed that xylanase activity increased suddenly synchronic to the appearance of the ethylene production peak at later stage, xylanase activity increased about 175 and 268 folds in peel and pulp in CK, 154 and 236 folds in peel and pulp in treatment, respectively, and activities in treatment were slightly lower than in control both in peel and pulp; while ethylene absorbent treatment postponed the reaching the peaks of xylanase activities, but did not change the pattern of it during storage, which means that its activity may be regulated by ethylene.

AB A CAS gene encoding cycloartenol synthase was cloned from Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis by homology based PCR method. The comparative analysis of full-length cDNA, using the BLASTN algorithm, showed that the cloned CAS gene shared more than 80% nucleotide sequence identity with the fragments from other plants encoding cycloartenol synthase. The CAS gene from Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis was cloned into the plant binary vector pBI121 in the antisense orientation and transformed into tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) by Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated method. 8 transgenic plants were obtained. PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and Southern blot analysis showed that the antiCAS gene had integrated into the genome of tomato. RT-PCR analysis of CAS gene inhibition in transgenic plants revealed that all the transgenic plants accumulated no detectable or extremely low levels of the CAS transcripts, whereas the CAS expression was obviously detectable in the non-transgenic plant. These results showed that the cloned CAS gene from Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis played an important role in plant cycloartenol synthase. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper uses T. aestivum, elytrigia intermedium and their distant hybrid progeny octoploid trititrigia as the test materials, and makes comparative analysis of the chromosome karyotypes of the three species with which have phylogenetic relationships by chromosome tablet method. The results show that: T. aestivum yannong15 has the karyotype formula as 2n=6x=42=30m+12sm (4SAT), and its karyotype is 2A; Elytrigia intermedium has the karyotype formula as 2n=6x=42=16m+20sm (4SAT)+6st, and its karyotype is 3B; Their distant hybrid progeny octoploid trititrigia shannongTE0521 has the karyotype formula as 2n=8x=56=36m (2SAT)+20sm (2SAT), and its karyotype is 2B. According to the karyotype evolutionary theory by Stebbins and the nuclear-based cladistic method, as well as analysis of the 4 traits of the karyotype, the results shows that the evolution of the octoploid trititrigia is in the middle of its two original parents. It is in this paper gives the first report of the karyotype of octoploid rititrigia, and makes preliminary study on the chromosomes and genetic evolution relationships of octoploid trititrigia and its original parents.

   weighting
AB The study of host pathogen protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is essential to understand the disease-causing mechanisms of human pathogens. A large number of scientific findings about PPIs are buried in the growing volume of biomedical literature. Document classification systems have been shown to have the potential to accelerate the curation process by retrieving PPI-related documents. However, it is usually a case that a small number of positive documents can be obtained manually or from PPI knowledge bases with literature-based evidence and there are a large number of negative documents. How to handle the imbalanced classification problem is becoming a hot topic in machine learning field. In this paper, we propose an Improved TFIDF (I_TFIDF) term weighting approach for imbalanced binary class text classification. It additionally considers two imbalanced factors (imbalanced occurring of term in two classes and imbalanced class distribution of training set). The proposed approach is compared with TFIDF term weighting approach utilizing Surport Vector Machine(SVM) machine learning on an imbalanced host pathogen protein-protein text corpora. The results demonstrate the proposed approach outperforms TFIDF approach and is obviously significant to improve the accuracy of classification of imbalanced data set. An automated classification system to identify MEDLINE abstracts referring to host-pathogen protein-protein interactions can been developed based on the experiment.

AB Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are important in understanding the fundamental processes governing cell biology. However, a large number of scientific findings about PPIs are buried in the growing volume of biomedical literature. Sentence extraction system has the potential to accelerate the curation process by highlighting the PPI-related sentences. In this paper, we present a mixed model to extract the host pathogen PPI-related sentences based on 1360 host-pathogen protein-protein interactions documents and some tagged PPI-related sentences. The model includes three parts: Abstract-level classification, Sentence-Level classification, Knowledge rule matching. The results show that the proposed model is effective to extract host pathogen PPI-related sentences from the MEDLINE abstracts. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The degradation of COD and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) in coking wastewater was researched using the new ultrastructure biological carriers in three-phase aerobic biological fluid-bed. The results show that the optimum conditions of the new biological carriers are as follows: HRT of 20 h, neutrality skew alkaline pH (about 7.5) and dissolved oxygen (DO) of 2 similar to 5mg/L. Under the optimum conditions, the removal efficiency of COD and NH3-N can reach 82% and 87%, respectively, when the influent concentration of COD and NH3-N is about 3000 mg/L and 60mg/L. At the same time, comparison with the activated sludge process and common biological ceramist carriers, it is found that the most excellent treatment effect and the strongest resistance to impact are obtained under the condition of the shortest HRT in this new ultrastructure biological carriers reactor, and the effluent of two-stage reactors in series can reach the first national discharge standard, which will has a wide application prospect.

AB Considering that the air pollution risk assessment is a variable fuzzy concept with multiple indicators and classes and there is the limit for the weight value of variable fuzzy evaluation method, the variable fuzzy mathematics method and the information entropy are combined to evaluate the air pollution risk of different seasons in sixteen districts of Beijing in 2009. The multi-objective group decision-making problem under air pollution risk has been solved by variable fuzzy method and the weight problem has been modified by information entropy, which makes the evaluating results more objective. From quantitative assessment, the air pollution risk of winter season in south seven districts of Beijing was on the margin in 2009. Beijing needs to optimize energy structure by introducing and developing the use of cleaner high-quality energy to decrease air pollution risk grade on winter. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A field sand burial experiment and a wind blowing experiment was conducted during 2006 and 2007 in the Horqin Sand Land to investigate the effects of wind blowing and sand burials on seedling growth and photosynthetic properties of Caragana microphylla. The results showed that 1) lightly sand burial (1/3 plant height) could synchronously hasten growth of stem and leaf and root and increase of biomass, moderate sand burial (2/3 plant height) only could stimulate root growth and biomass increase and restrain height growth; heavy sand burial (100% height) could result in death of most plant and poor growth of alive plant while all plant died under severe sand burial (130% plant height); 2) in the sweltering summer of Horqin Sand Land, it maybe not beneficial to photosynthesis and transpiration if moving speed of airflow is lower (2m s(-1), light air), suitable wind velocity (6m s(-1) gentle breeze) maybe beneficial to transpiration as well as photosynthesis. transpiration rate not also increased visibly, but also photosynthetic rate decreased in larger rang while wind velocity is >8.0m s(-1) which is not good for plant growth. 3) although C. microphylla as a dominant shrub of fixed sand has certain ability to adapt wind blowing and sand burial, but severe sand burial and strong wind blowing should resulted in severe damage so much as death to C. microphylla, so it pay much attention that don't plant C. microphylla in upper intensively areas of wind-sand activity.

AB A split-plot field experiment, with watering as main plot and with fertilizer as sub-plot, was carried out in degraded sandy grassland in Horqin Sandy Land. Four treatments (0mm, 30mm, 60mm and 90mm) for watering and four treatments (0 kg/hm(2), 150 kg/hm2, 375 kg/hm(2), 600 kg/hm(2)) for fertilizer as nitrogen were designed. Results showed that the soil water storage was significant affected by rainfall in this grassland. Watering factor had significant influence on the soil water storage in 0-30cm depths but no significant influence for deeper than 30cm soil layer. Both the watering and fertilizer took important roles in increasing biomass in degraded sandy grassland. The highest above-biomass appeared at the plot in 90mm with 128.3g/m(2) among watering treatments and at the sub-plot in 600 kg/ha with 147.3g/m(2) between fertilizer treatments, respectively. The water consumption and WUE of each of treatments was 379mm / 0.28 kg/mm.hm(2) in 90mm treatment, 350mm/0.38 kg/mm.hm(2) for 60mm treatment, 313mm / 0.34 kg/mm.hm(2) for 30mm treatment, and 294 mm /0.35 kg/mm.hm(2) for control (0mm), respectively. Based on comprehensive analysis, we can conclude that the basic amount of evapotranspiration in this grassland was 294mm. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, the sorption of heavy metals (Cu2+, Pb2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+) from simulated metallurgical wastewater by sepiolite under different dosage, pH, adsorption time and temperature conditions was investigated. The results showed that adsorption increased with the increase of adsorbent dosage until the adsorption equilibrium was reached. When the pH is 6, adsorption of heavy metal ions by sepiolite was in the order of Cu2+> Zn2+> Pb2+> Cd2+ and removal rates of the metal ion were 91%, 90%, 91%, 84%, respectively. The effect of adsorption time on adsorption was not significant. At room temperature, with the adsorption time 45 min, the adsorption of metal ions is almost saturated, adsorption of Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+ was 13.05mg/g, 85.47mg/g, 62.36mg/g and 15.67mg/g, respectively.

AB Water Environment in Shanghai got more and more attentions. The hotspots are wastewater discharge and pollutant content in Changjiang and Huangpu rivers. From 1981 to 2009, the city wastewater discharge was fluctuated between 1800*10(6) ton and 2400*10(6) ton. Inside, the gross of industrial wastewater was trendily decreasing from more than 1300*10(6) ton at 1980s to about 700*10(6) ton recently years. The percent of industrial wastewater was decreasing continuously from 76.88% at 1981 to 28.42% at 2009. The gross of living wastewater was increasing trendily, it related with increasing of city population. In the same period, the living wastewater per year for per person was increasing from about 37 ton at the beginning of 1980s to 80 ton at recent year, about 1.2 times increasing in past 30 years. The month flux of chemical pollutant discharged by Changjiang River was between 259*10(3) ton to 2096*10(3) ton in recently years. The average pollutant gross carried by Changjiang River in year, was about 5934.5*10(3) ton among 2002 to 2009; about 83.68% was COD. Other pollutants were nutrients, oil, heavy metal and arsenic, the variability was larger with year. The month flux of pollutant carried by Huangpu River was 25.6*10(3) ton, more than 63% was COD averagely. The pollutant gross had an increasing trend year by year. Generally, the percent of pollutant from Huangpu River was about 3.6 to 4.4% compared with that in Changjiang River. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The 170 releves obtained from sampling investigation in Barkoissi, Galangashi and Oti-Keran protected areas (Northern Togo) were subjected to several multivariate analyses. The study has the aim to identify and to describe the main plant communities and the major environment factor which influence the species distribution. The Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) and Hierarchical clustering were used to ordinate and to classify samples which led, to determine the major plant communities. The plant community was defined by Indicator Value such as fidelity and abundance. The results showed that seven plant communities were identified with the 170 releves. The releves were well distributed in DCA factorial plan formed by axe 1 and 2. The plant communities were distributed along the moisture gradient in the DCA ordination. The diversity indices in both plant communities are well significant and indicate a good distribution of species in the area. In overall, few plant communities show high similarity between them.

AB This Laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the possibility of using crushed waste clay brick as aggregates in cement treated materials for sub-base. In this study, Five kinds of aggregates which contained 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% crushed bricks were treated by 5% cement respectively. The results indicated that cement treated aggregates which contains crushed waste brick had a lower MDD and a higher OMC. This was mainly attributed to the lower density and higher water rate of crushed brick compared to those of natural aggregate. Moreover, the replacement of natural aggregate by crushed brick further decreased the UCS, tensile splitting strength and frost resistance index of cement treated aggregate and increased the thermal shrinkage coefficient of the cement treated aggregate slightly. Although the use of crushed waste bricks affected the mechanical properties of cement treated aggregate, the UCSs of all mixtures in this study were greater than 1.5 MPa, which is a minimum UCS requirements of cement treated aggregate sub-base material for asphalt pavement design specifications in China. The cement treated aggregate which contains crushed brick should be used cautiously in the frozen region due to its poor frost resistance performance. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE NDVI; Land change; Biomass; Lome
AB To assess land change around Lome urban and peri-urban areas, the logical technique of RGB-NDVI associated to unsupervised classification was applied to three satellite images of different dates. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was computed for the three images to define high and low vegetation biomass. Then colour composites were generated by combining each date of NDVI with either the red, green and blue (RGB) image layers in an image. The output of the classified image was interpreted by the means of additive colour to detect biomass change (vegetation reduction and regeneration) across the landscape on the multitemporal NDVI classified colour composite. The analysis results show that, in a whole, there was a great change in land resources, especially between 1986 and 2001. The landscape dynamics, such us biomass degradation or restoration is more visible between 2001 and 2007. Althoug there was a small area so far well conserved, it remains under urbanization high pressure. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Given the growing stock of household electrical appliances, China is faced with an urgent challenge of management of household appliances massive disposal. Unfortunately, the majority of waste household appliances are now processed in small workshops mainly by manual disassembly and open incineration which are extremely polluting and health-harming in China. In response to the increasing environmental concerns over household appliance end-of-life treatment, The Regulations on the Administration of the Recovery and Disposal of Waste Electrical and Electronic Products (WEEE Regulations), was promulgated in 2009. To discuss the potential benefits from the implementation of the Regulations, a holistic understanding of the waste appliance recycling business and after-end-of -life markets is indispensable. This paper presents a life cycle simulation model to evaluate the potential environmental benefits from the improved end-of-life management. The proposed model provides a mathematical description of close-loop lifecycles and yields quantitative results of energy and raw material consumption and waste generation. Then, as a case study, the environmental benefits of household refrigerator recycling and reuse system compliant to the Regulations is analyzed based on comparison of simulation results of two scenarios respectively representing implementing and not implementing of the Regulations. The proposed model is expected to facilitate policy-and decision-making on product recycling and reuse. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Dramatic changes in Arctic climate have been noted during the past century. Increasing oceanic temperature, ice melting and ocean freshening not only affect the Arctic but also become a global Environment Problem. We review the change of atmospheric climate, the retreat of sea ice, the freshwater loss and discuss the mechanisms that contributed to these changes. Then we analyze the interaction between the Arctic and the North Pacific and the interaction between the Arctic and the Atlantic. Finally we summarize the role that the climate change in the Arctic played in the global climate change. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Based on measurements of radiation fluxes at a suburban and a rural site in Beijing city simultaneously during the period from June to December in 2009, the contrastive characteristics and diurnal variations of radiation budget and surface albedo at different landscapes were analyzed. The results show that daily mean values of radiation components and net radiation in summer were higher than those in winter at study sites. Moreover, diurnal values of radiation components and net radiation were generally smaller at suburban than those at rural site, except for upward longwave radiation. Mean albedo values in summer was 0.149 at suburban and 0.152 at rural sites, which separately lower than 0.335 at suburban and 0.278 rural sites in winter, due to solar angle and surface seasonal characteristics. More radiation measurements to conduct at various urban land-use types are required in the further. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB To enhance the productivity of the land, different types of fertilizer is being used. Basically, different drivers like the demand of crops, variation in the price of output and changing relative factors are influencing to increase the use of fertilizer. However, increased use and unplanned production of fertilizer has an adverse impact on the environment. But that type of hidden cost is not possible to measure objectively. So, it seems plausible to internalize these types of cost. ISO 14000 is one that helps firm to reduce the adverse impact on environment. This paper explores the current situation of the fertilizer (chemical) sector of Bangladesh regarding the implementation of ISO 14000. Empirical results indicate that fertilizer sector is enjoying the growth without ensuring ISO 14000 properly. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Based on life cycle theory, this article divided life cycle energy into embodied energy and operating energy, then analyzed case data on 63 buildings from 10 countries. First, this article applied linear regression analysis to build a linear model. High degree of coefficient of determination indicated high correlation existing between operating energy and life cycle energy. Further, the article employed one-sample t-test and compared the means of embodied energy in order to prove that low-energy buildings could reduce operating energy as well as embodied energy at present. At last, by one-way analysis of variance, this study showed the energy used in office buildings was much greater than that used in residential buildings. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Carbon dioxide is one of greenhouse gases. The development and application of carbon dioxide capture storage technology can not only alleviate the current pressure on the environment of global warming, but also can bring huge economic benefits. At present, the commonly methods of carbon dioxide separation are chemical absorption, physical absorption, membrane separation and adsorption separation. These Separation methods all have own characteristics in economy, selectivity and applicability. But Chemical Absorption Method and PSA are used more widely in industry. So several capture methods by chemical absorption or PSA were suggested for carbon dioxide emission form flue gas in coal-fired power plant, exhaust gas of industrial furnace or biogas.

AB Recently river corridors in Guangzhou are being focused on as important natural networks in urban environment as well as cultural and recreational resources. This paper took East Ho Chung River Greenway in Guangzhou as an object to do some comprehensive evaluation of its built environment by the method of the post occupancy evaluation (POE), such as questionnaires, interviews and statistics. The questionnaire is divided into 6 categories, such as facilities, green space, signs and maps, transport, security and management, and recreational activities in external environment. Through the analysis, we identified six human dimensions in the studies: cleanliness, aesthetic, comfort, safety, suitability and hydrophilic property. As a result of this research, some problems on the evaluation were grasped by the hierarchy process analysis based on the six categories and user's six human dimensions. We concluded by discussing solutions of these problems, and suggested some proposals in design to meet the users' requirement for the future construction of greenway. This study aims to improve the quality of East Ho Chung River Greenway's built environment, and to make the greenway design more scientific. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE magnesia; flue gas desulfurization; magnesia activity; sulfite oxidation
AB This paper studied the magnesia flue gas desulfurization technology. It also carried out single-factor desulfurization and sulfite oxidation experiments by exploring the activity of magnesia after calcination and slaking process of magnesia slurry. The results show that residence time and slaking time had a negligible effect on the activity of magnesia in 7 days after calcination. In the experimental range, SO2 removal efficiency decreased by increasing the gas flow and inlet SO2 concentration. The SO2 removal efficiency increased with the increase in liquid-gas ratio, absorption temperature, concentration of magnesia slurry, and residence time of magnesia slurry. Magnesium sulfate with a certain concentration added to the magnesia solution has no effect on the desulfurization and oxidation of sulfite. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID BIOTECHNOLOGY
AB Biofiltration is one of the major treatment processes for odor and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) control. In this study, a two-stage biofilter was developed to treat odor and VOCs from sludge dewatering facility of a wastewater treatment plant(WWTP) in ShanDong province. The objectives were to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the two-stage biofilter to treat odor and VOCs. The main compounds emitted from the WWTP were sulfide hydrogen, ammonia and total volatile organic compounds containing acetone, acetic acid and toluene. Results indicated that the two-stage biofilter can remove the inlet odor and VOCs efficiently. Compounds with different characteristics were removed in different stage, respectively. Most of sulfide hydrogen and toluene were biooxidized by acidophilic thiobacilli and fungi in the first stage which operated at low pH. And the removal efficiencies of other hydrophilic compounds were higher in the second stage which operated at high pH. The two-stage biofilter has been proved to be an efficient system to treat the complex mixture of odor and VOCs emitted from the WWTP. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphor and sulfur are the most important processes in agricultural landscape, which more or less contributes to global changes. Based on the resource data got from household surveys combined with land use data derived from remote sensing imagery, this article studied on the long-term changes of main life elements (C, N and P) fluxes in a typical agricultural landscape of North China Plain. The results show that C and N balances of large-scale irrigated land changed from deficits (-865kg/hm2 C and -9kg/hm2 N) in 1945 into great surpluses (1761kg/hm2 C and 213kg/hm2 N) in 2002, respectively, and P surpluses also doubled in 2002. However, C and N fluxes showed deficit during both periods with more significantly in 2002. C, N and P fluxes in whole arable landscape showed significant surpluses despite of 18.75% total arable area decrease in 2002 than that in 1945. Contrarily, C and N fluxes of arable landscape in 1945 showed overall deficits. Nutrient flux changes of arable landscape are impacted mainly by the changes of fertilizer input, land productivity, crop residue utility and arable land types. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Estuarine processes have long been important to oceanographic researcher. The closeness of estuaries to land & the diversity of physical activity found within them have stimulated interest in estuaries as individual systems. An overview of the current design practices in the field of renewable energy is presented; also paper delineates the background to the development of unique & novel techniques for power generation using the kinetic energy of tidal streams & other marine currents. Tidal stream devices have been developed as an alternative method of extracting the energy from the tides. This form of tidal power technology poses less threat to the environment & does not face the same limiting factors associated with tidal barrage schemes, therefore making it a more feasible method of electricity production. Universally the tides can be harness with tidal turbines-of which there are two main bifurcation-vertical axis & horizontal axis. In this paper only the vertical axis tidal turbine is focused. Some suggestion & corrosion prevention techniques are also discussed in this study. In addition, the progression of technological advancements tracing several decades of R&D efforts on vertical axis turbines are highlighted. The purpose of this review paper is to build up a confidence level for further study in this field in depth. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID RING GROWTH-RESPONSES; DENDROCLIMATIC RECONSTRUCTION
AB This analysis aims to evaluate the hypothesis that the effect of age on the climate signals should be considered, even if the inherent biological trend has been removed using dendroecological techniques. 72 young and old Pinus koraiensis trees from broad-leaved and coniferous mixed forests were disaggregated into two age classes, the young trees (average age 63 years) and the old trees (average age 184 years) and analyzed to evaluate this hypothesis. Our results that tree-ring width tendencies and climate signals are age-related support the hypothesis that sensitivity to particular climatic conditions varies with age. Firstly, young trees always grow faster than old ones at the same climate condition. Secondly, young trees are more sensitive to mean temperature. While the growth of old trees correlates with monthly precipitation. In addition, common dendrochronological techniques can remove the natural biological growth trend, but lose more climate information with low frequency, especially for young trees.

AB Vegetable Precursors banana peels and maize cob were prepared as adsorbents for the adsorption of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions and Commercial activated carbon in granular form was also used. Cr(VI) concentration and pH were varied. The adsorption capacities were decreased in the order for CAC > MC > BP. The isotherm data could be well described by the Freundlich and Langmuir equations in the concentration range of 50-300 mg/l. An acidic pH was favorable for the adsorption of Cr(VI). Based on the adsorption capacity, it was shown that CAC was more effective absorbent than maize cob followed by banana peels. Kinetic parameters of adsorption such as the pseudo-second-order kinetic rate constants were determined. Both agriculture wastes(MC and BP) and commercial activated charcoal (CAC) were shown to be used successfully materials for adsorption removal of Cr(VI) from aqueous solutions.

DE Indoor air quality (IAQ); Nanometer TiO2; Photocatalytic degradation;
   Interior landscape plants
AB Indoor air quality (IAQ) of residential building is closely related to human health. By measurements of formaldehyde, benzene, ammonia, total volatile organic compounds (TVOCS) and radon in new decorated residential building in Hangzhou, we found 53.3% sampleds of TVOCS, 50% samples of formaldehyde,,16.7% samples of ammonia exceed of China's national standard for indoor air environmental pollution respectively. The methods of improving IAQ are discussed in this thesis. The main study is on degradation and absorption of formaldehyde using nanometer TiO2 photocatalyst and parts of interior landscape plants. Anatase phase TiO2 photocatalyst supported on fiberglass cloth was prepared by using sol-gel method. The experiments of formaldehyde photocatalytic degradation were conducted with nanometer TiO2 photocatalyst prepared at temperature of 400 degrees C, 450 degrees C, 500 degrees C respectively. The result indicates that TiO2 photocatalyst prepared at 450 degrees has the best photocatalytic activity. The experiments result of formaldehyde absorption with seven kinds of interior landscape plants shows that improving IAQ with interior landscape plants is effective.

AB The quantities of chemical components in groundwater samples were determined and submitted to statistical analysis. The majority of the samples contained high concentrations of Na+ (37-1430 mg/L) and Cl-(60.06 - 2682.94 mg/L) (Na-Cl water type), indicate the intrusion of salt water into the groundwater. The samples also contained high concentrations of NO3- (0.4-377 mg/L), which is a serious water quality issue. This nitrate originates from the soil surface and enters the groundwater by infiltration. The high content of these chemical components, which has disadvantage on drinking water, proves the giving up of the boreholes by the population. Multivariate statistical techniques used in this study were enable to identify the key parameters which describe groundwater quality and to characterize the spatial variability of groundwater quality data.

AB Multi-scale continuous wavelet analysis is carried out for annual runoff of Lower Nandujiang River. The analysis is based on the runoff data observed at Longtang Hydrological Station of Nandujiang River from the year 1956 to 2000. Based on wavelet analysis, variation tendency of annual discharge in Lower Nandujiang River is predicted. Analysis results show that the Morlet wavelet applies well to natural runoff prediction in this area. The variation intensity of annual runoff of Lower Nandujiang River shows intensive fluctuations at time scales of 3 similar to 7 years, 9 similar to 19 years and 25 similar to 39 years. Besides, the periodic components of runoff time-series are identified and extracted according to wavelet variance. Quantitative analysis shows that the major period of runoff variation of Lower Nandujiang River is 13 years. Prediction results provide valuable information for urban planning of Haikou City, where Lower Nandujiang River flows into the sea. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The purpose of this paper is to transform inefficient water conservation forests in Jinyun Mountain, as well as provide a basis for inefficient forest transformation. In this paper, we get forest reserves, maximum water holding capacity, maximum water holding rate and some hydrological parameters of different forest litter types through the water-holding characteristics analysis of three kinds of litter in Jinyun Mountain. The litter reserve of standard plot one is 874.33g/m(2), 980g/m(2) in standard plot two, and 264.22g/m(2) in standard plot three. The maximum water holding rate of undecomposed layer of standard plot one is 183.56%, 177.98% in standard plot two, and 219.49% in standard plot three. The maximum water holding rate of semi-decomposed layer of standard plot one is 246.08%, 106.08% in standard plot two, and 250.88% in standard plot three. The maximum water holding capacity of undecomposed layer of standard plot one is 684.68g/m(2), 557.66g/m(2) in standard plot two, and 180.23g/m(2) in standard plot three. The maximum water holding capacity of semi-decomposed layer of standard plot one is 1167.23g/m(2), 707.20g/m(2) in standard plot two, and 456.88g/m(2) in standard plot three. The results indicated that the maximum water holding capacity from high to low is standard plot one > standard plot two > standard plot three. The maximum water holding rate from high to low is standard plot three > standard plot one > standard plot two. The water holding capacity of coniferous and broadleaf mixed forest litter is more than coniferous mixed forest litter. It is further illustrates that the more complex stand structure, the more water holding capacity of litter will be. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Analysis of low-Carbon for all aspects of power system is summarized. To optimize allocation of distributed generation in distribution network, three indexes are introduced to evaluate distributed generation (DG) profits, namely low-carbon expense index, voltage security index and active power loss index, furthermore, the multi-objective optimization model for distributed generation was established, the multi-objective program is turned into a single objective program with the maximum satisfaction method. An artificial intelligent algorithm namely the plant growth simulation algorithm (PGSA), is employed to solve the optimal planning of DG. Calculation example shows that the proposed optimal planning model of DG is effective and feasible; the simulating results illustrate the correctness and availability of the proposed algorithm.

AB During the liquid hot water pretreatment of lignocellulosic materials such as corn stalk, hemicellulose is hydrolyzed into monosaccharides, and meanwhile, toxic by-products are simultaneously generated, which may influence L-lactic acid fermentation. Studies on the inhibitory effects of the by-products on L-lactic acid fermentation are of practical use for further improvement of L-lactic acid yield from lignocellulosic materials. In this study, one by-product, vanillin, was identified in the hydrolysate of local corn stalk, which was added into the medium at different concentrations to study their impacts on the growth and L-lactic acid fermentation of a Rhizopus oryzae (AS3.819). The work indicated that L-lactic acid production was inhibited by vanillin to a lesser extent than that to the growth. Vanillin caused a much longer lag-phase in growth when the concentration was 0.8 g/l, which showed remarkably inhibition effect, and the lag-phase was not obvious at lower concentrations. At the concentration of 1 g/l, vanillin completely inhibited the fermentation as well as the cell growth. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Xieyou 9308; Photoperiod sensitive; Sowing date; Transplanting date
AB This paper had studied on photoperiod sensitivity and suitable sowing and transplanting dates for super rice Xieyou 9308 as a double-cropping late rice with Shanyou 10 as control. For expirement of sowing date, 5 treatments were set up respectively sowing on June 10, June 15, June 20, June 25, June 30 for Xieyou9308 and for expirement of transplanting date, 5 other treatments were set up respectively transplanting on July 15, July 20, July 25, July 30, August 4 for Xieyou9308 with all treatments sown on June 20, with Shouyou 10 as the control. This experiment was conducted Under the natural field environment in Wenzhou, China. The result showed that photoperiod sensitivity of Xieyou 9308 was stronger than that of Shanyou 10. Sowing from June 10 to June 30, the full heading stage advanced by 1 day for super rice 9308 and Shanyou 10 by 2 days with advanced sowing every 5 days. The optimum sowing date for Xieyou 9308 was fixed on June 25 according to conditions of light and temperature in Wenzhou. Too early sowing can not significantly advanced the full heading stage, but the yield of rice cut down because of the extension of seedling age and lower quality of seedling, and too late sowing will effect on the full heading of rice because of low temperature after late September. Sowing simultaneously on June 20 and transplanting from July 15 to August 4, the full heading stages advaced about 1 day with advanced transplanting every 5 days for Xieyou 9308 and Shanyou 10, and the yields of earlier transplanting trearments were significantly higher than that of later transplanting treatments. Due to its strong photoperiod sensitivity and longer growth period, Xieyou 9308 should be transplanted as early as possible when it is planted as a double-cropping late rice.

AB This study aimed to prepare high-sensitivity monoclonal antibodies against Ractopamine (Rac), which provided a solid foundation for icELISA kit. Mixed anhydride method was employed to synthesize the immunogen of Rac-BSA and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether was used to prepare the coating antigen of Rac-OVA, thus pursue the heterologous sensitivity. Through cell fusion technology, four Hybridoma cell lines named R1-B5, R2-B3, R2-C6, and R4-C8 were screened out, their corresponding mAbs were of the IgG(1) isotype with k light chain, and the Kafs of all mAbs were between 2.7 and 4.8x10(9) L/mol. Based on the R1-B5, a heterologous icELISA method was developed. The working range was from 0.013 to 33.7 ng/mL, with LOD and IC50 value of 0.007 ng/mL and 0.67 ng/mL, respectively. Except for a higher cross-reactivity (42.7%) to Dobutamine, negligible cross-reactivity to the other compounds was observed. The recoveries of Rac were in the range of 98.2-109.5%, 85.7-110.5% and 97.4-101.8% for cattle muscle, liver and kidney, respectively, with coefficients of variation (CV) values all <10%. When applied in real samples, the correlation coefficient (R-2) of the ELISA and LC-MS was 0.9373 in cattle muscle. Therefore, this assay can be used for detecting Rac residue in animal products.

AB In order to solve hypoxic problems in high altitude area and ensure workers life safety, a new cycle named as Low Pressure Swing Adsorption for oxygen concentration was proposed. In this cycle, the high efficiency liking Vacuum Pressure Swing Adsorption was obtained but the vacuum was not used. The relationship between oxygen concentration and oxygen flux was revealed. And the matching air content curve in different altitudes was acquired. Basing on the experiment data, the life safety system with oxygen supplied for workers was suggested. After using this system, the oxygen partial pressure of the tunnel face could be enhanced by 2 - 3 kPa and the incidence of AMS in the workers decreased significantly, blood oxygen saturation increased, pulse rate and breaths per minute decreased.

AB A method of screening nitrifiers at low temperature was presented in this paper: enrichment of nitrifiers at 12 degrees C, bacterium isolation and purification, preliminary screening and determination of nitrification effect. According to the above method, two kinds of ammonia-oxidation bacteria and two kinds of nitrite-oxidation bacteria were screened and separated from soil in cold area of north China, with the ammonia removal efficiency of 53%similar to 62% and nitrite removal efficiency of 31%similar to 36%, respectively. Some ecological factors impacting nitrification effect were discussed and the results showed that the most suitable temperature for the bacteria was 25 degrees C and the most appropriated pH value was in slightly alkaline range (pH 7.0-8.0). In the stable operating conditions, over 90% removal rate for ammonia and 70% removal rate for total nitrogen could be observed. At the same time, relatively high COD removal rate could be reached stably at 90%, which means both organic matter and ammonia could be removed together in the same reactor. The ecological factors analysis indicated that neither nitrite bacteria nor nitrate bacteria would be significantly influenced in growth and activity at 12 degrees C similar to 15 degrees C and the system could be operated stably at pH value of 7.0-8.0.

AB This work investigated the technology of seawater flue gas desulfurization. The results show that the liquid-gas ratio and gas-flow rate significantly influence SO2 removal efficiency. The inlet concentration of SO2 and temperature of the absorption solution have little effect on the SO2 removal efficiency. The effects of additives on desulfurization and desulfurization seawater recovery were observed by introducing different concentrations and types of additives. Inorganic and organic additives could increase SO2 removal efficiency to a certain degree. Organic additives have negative effects on seawater recovery, and inorganic additives have little influence on seawater recovery with increasing SO2 removal efficiency.

AB A simple method for in situ synthesis of alpha-Fe nanoparticles in ordered mesoporous silica (OMS) matrix is presented. Well dispersed alpha-Fe nanoparticles in OMS were directly obtained by evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) process and subsequent carbothermal treatment under a nitrogen atmosphere. The main strategy of this approach is to use EO20PO70EO20 (P123) as not only a template for assembly of mesostructure in the EISA process but also a reactive agent for reducing ferric species to alpha-Fe nanoparticles in subsequent carbothermal treatment process. The amphiphilic triblock copolymer P123 plays essential roles in this method. The synthesized composites with Fe/Si molar ratio ranging from 0.05 to 0.2 were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and N-2 adsorption. Characterization revealed carbothermal treatment of the composite at 800 degrees C gave highly dispersed alpha-Fe nanoparticles in hexagonal OMS matrix. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ginsenoside is the most important secondary metabolite of ginseng, and the metabolite of Ginsenoside Rb1 has various pharmacological activities, such as anti-tumor properties. Although various chemical and biological methods have been reported of preparation for it, enzymatic production by microbial bioconversion is able to produce engineering range metabolite with specific selectivity and high efficiency. In this study, to achieve minor pharmacological ginsenoside Compound-K from major ginsenoside using microbial biotransformation, many soil bacteria which have strong beta-glucosidase activity were isolated. The screening was performed on esculin containing 1/10 TSA agar plate and then observed color development. The selected positive isolates were cultured 1000ppm G-Rb1 and the products were analyzed by TLC (thin-layer-chromatography) and HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) method. One novel bacterial strain ZY-3 could hydrolyze ginsenoside Rb1 to the active metabolites Compound-K through F2 and Rd. Based on phylogenetical tree, it was found to belong to genus Sphingomonas and was very close to Sphingomonas jaspsi TDMA-16(T) and Sphingomonas astaxanthinifaciens TDMA-17(T) (96.8%, 96.5%, similarity based on 16S rRNA sequence). The bioconversion production of Compound-K occurred by consecutive hydrolyses of the terminal sugar moieties at the C-20 carbon and hydrolyses of the terminal and inner C-3 carbon of ginsenoside Rb1 showing the biotransformation pathway: Rb1 -> Rd -> F2 -> Compound-K.

AB Volume rendering has become an important technique for visualizing and exploring features in 3D scalar fields. However, it is difficult to visualize important structures and boundaries in volume datasets since different types of tissues are represented in overlap ranges of scalar values. In this paper, we propose a novel orientation visualizing transfer function to reveal inner structures and orientations of materials. In our approach, gradients are projected from 3D space onto RGB color space. Since both the directions and magnitudes of gradients are exploited, structures of similar scalar values and gradient magnitudes can still be distinguished by their orientations. Experiment results show our approach provides clear perspectives of the structures and unique features in visualizing orientation related details. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Two different analytical methods for the detection of Sarafloxacin (SAR) residue in poultry have been developed, and the comparison was also performed. For this purpose, anti-SAR monoclonal antibody (mAb) was produced through cell fusion technology and SAR-HRP tracer was synthesized using EDC method. Based on the characteristics of mAbs and square matrix titration, a direct competitive ELISA (dcELISA) method was established. The working range in assay buffer was from 0.004 to 18 ng/mL, with LOD and IC50 value of 0.002 ng/mL and 0.32 ng/mL, respectively. This assay showed negligible cross-reactivity (<0.05%) to other compounds tested, showing highly specific. When applied in authentic poultry samples, no significant differences between the dcELISA and the confirmatory LC-MS/MS were observed. The correlation coefficient (R-2) values were 0.9876 and 0.995 in chicken, 0.9959 and 0.9841 in duck, 0.9822 and 0.9952 in geese, for dcELISA and LC-MS/MS, respectively. The results suggest it was an advantage through coupling of dcELISA as screening method and LC-MS/MS as confirmatory method for detecting SAR residue in poultry. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB TroponinC2 (TNNC2), a constituent of the troponin complex located on the thin filament, plays a critical role in skeletal muscle contraction and improving meat quality traits of livestock and poultry. The TNNC2 gene has been identified in many mammals, but very little known about goat. In the study, we cloned TNNC2 gene in goat for the first time and analyzed its tissue expression. Results indicated that TNNC2 contains 483bp CDS and encodes 160 amino acids, and it was selectively expressed in the muscular tissues of goat. Its nucleotide sequence was high similar with sheep (93.38%) and alpaca (90.48%), and the identity of encoded amino acids which was varied from 100% (sheep) to 70.81% (Atlantic salmon) in animal. We found that the Ala(113) and leu(132) was distributed very law in mammals. The amino acid residue of Ca2+ binding sites. was identical in mammals, Aves and amphibian. This study may provide more insight into the molecular structure and expression patterns of the vertebrate TNNC2 gene. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The general mechanism of transcription initiation is dependent on protein-DNA interaction. The promoter DNA has to possess the required 3D structure to allow DNA-binding events and accommodate alterations in activator protein positioning in order to allow the start of transcription. In this study, we introduced physical structural variables by defining three displacements (rise, shift and slide) and three rotation angles (twist, roll and tilt) for each dinucleotide to describe transcription initiation of four model organism genomes. The analysis results reveal that there are specific structural patterns in the core promoter region, and confirm that the existence of a hidden physical code which can modulates the gene transcription initiation. The results demonstrate that there is significant diversity in the geometric flexibility for different organizations. We believe the structure features originate from DNA 3D structures can describe the actual process of gene transcription initiation better than the curvature propensity or other general flexibility.

AB A formulation of nano-encapsulated enantiomer of (+)promethazine with desired release rate has been synthesized for establish a localized drug delivery system. It was tested on a hind limb suspension (HLS) disuse rat model, and by using a non-destructive Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and x-ray techniques to qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the new bone formations. Our studies suggest that nanoencapsulated (+)promethazine in controlled release formulations are effective in promoting bone growth in a rat model. Conjugating bone-targeting functional groups to the nanoparticles further enhances the efficacy of the drug. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB An immunoassay method for determination of Fluoroquinolones (FQs) residues in water samples has been developed. For this purpose, NHS ester technology was employed to synthesize the immunogen and coating antigen of Sarafloxacin (SAR). SDS-PAGE, UV-visible spectra and Infrared spectra identification showed that the artificial antigen was conjugated successfully. Based on the square matrix titration, an icELISA method was established. The dynamic range in assay buffer was from 0.048 to 62.4 ng/mL, with LOD and IC50 value of 0.018 ng/mL and 2.5 ng/mL, respectively. This assay showed a high cross-reactivity to Difloxacin (86.7%), Norfloxacin (63.2%), and Pefloxacin (33.8%). When applied in authentic tap water, river water and fishing water samples, the recoveries for Sarafloxacin, Difloxacin, Norfloxacin and Pefloxacin were 89.5-119.5, 90.5-121.2, 92.1-118.6, and 88.2-116.8%, respectively, with coefficient of variation (CV) values all <10%. The results suggest this immunoassay can be used for simultaneous detecting Sarafloxacin, Difloxacin, Norfloxacin, and Pefloxacin residues in water samples. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A first-principle study based on density functional theory was conducted to investigate the interaction of ethanethiol molecule with both defected and defect-free graphene. The calculated results reveal that the ethanethiol molecules can be bound to the surface of defected graphene more tightly in comparison with the defect-free graphene. The configurations and density of states of the combined systems show that the interaction between the ethanethiol molecule and defected graphene is quite different from the defect-free graphene, which is consistent with the Mulliken analyses. It is expected that the simulation results presented in this work would be valuable to the applications of various graphene-based nanometer devices. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Polymer is the essential material of computer equipment, however so far polymer wastewater is hard to treat in the world. In this paper the state of wastewater treatment was investigated in polymer factory and a new analysis method was used to study the characterization of the pollutants for polymer wastewater by membrane. The COD of polymer wastewater is complicated, involving colloid (1-5nm) (58.59% COD),. <0.1 mu m portions (21.41% COD), and no more than 200 molecular weight substance (20% COD). The ammonia-nitrogen mainly is the small molecular (88.30%), which can be removed by UF and RO membrane. SO32- is the same as the ammonia-nitrogen, and the SO32- of the polymer tower effluent is 122.57 mg/L, which respectively could be cut off almost half by UF and RO membrane. Then treatment technology is recommended by these analysis data. So membrane gradient separation, as a useful tool for better interpretation of wastewater, is apparently vital for water quality analysis and engineering project design.

AB In order to provide a new method for the treatment of printing and dyeing wastewater, the experiment studies how to treat dyeing-printing wastewater by IC reactor, refluent tank (10L), self-regulating control valve making of medical infusion, air flow meter which the basic units of (mL/min), dissolved oxygen instrument, aerator pumps (3.5W) and aeration equipment under the micro-aerobic condition; The prophase experiment is that wastewater was flocculated. The step is: first, PH of the printing and dyeing wastewater would be changed to 7.5 or so, then, wastewater and flocculants (10% PAC flocculants and 0.05% PAM coagulant aids) were mixed and the mixing ratio of was 400 to 1. at last, the decolorizing ratio was stable at 46% approximately; after the biodegradability of dyeing wastewater improving, under the dissolved oxygen -0.3 similar to 0.5mg/L (ms) condition, the printing and dyeing wastewater (my) was diluted by domestic sewage which mixing ratio is 7 to 3. Then added the printing and dyeing wastewater gradually, and held the increase ratio of influent COD load as 7% and mixed water COD load steadily as 25%. When the influent load reached 4655.1mg / L or so, dissolved oxygen was 0.3 similar to 0.5mg / L, HRT was 6h, the reactor worked best, this moment, the removal rate of COD could reach 85.8%; when the micro-oxygen granular sludge can deal with printing and dyeing wastewater effectively, under the appropriate influent load, compared the influence of two micro-oxygen conditions of the dissolved oxygen concentration 0.5 similar to 0.8 (mg/L) and 0.8 similar to 1.0 (mg/L) on system performance to that of the higher concentration of dissolved oxygen 1.0 similar to 1.2(mg/L) in the runback water; In order to create a good living environment for granular sludge, during the experiment, inoculation sludge, pH of influent and effluent, influent load operation, HRT are controlled strictly, as a result, it is discovered that the temperature change affects the decolorization. At about 15 degrees C, the decolorization rate is very low, only about 12.7 percent, however, when the temperature at around 25 degrees C, the decolorizing rate increases rapidly, about 75.8%; at around 35 degrees C, the decolorizing rate tends to maintained slowly at around 80.7 percent.

DE micro-aerobic; granular sludge; removal rate
AB The degradation characteristic of micro-organisms in the aerobic granular sludge system is different from that in the aerobic granular sludge system or anaerobic granular sludge system. At the beginning, the concentration of inflow water keeps the COD influent concentration in the end of cultivation of anaerobic granular sludge: 3418mg / L stably, the volume load of reactor : 33.4kgCOD/(m3.d), HRT : 7h, the main flow velocity of water : 2L/h, back-flow influent velocity : 0.6L /h, the concentration of dissolved oxygen in refluent tank : 0.3 similar to 0.5mg/L. The influent pH after 37 days, pH of influent is controlled 6.5 above. The COD removal rate, the reducing of HRT takes 0.5h space; when the COD removal ratio is stable, the improving velocity of back-flow water takes 0.2L/h space and HRT keeps 7h. When the influent organic load upgraded 385.7 g COD / d eventually after 8 times improvement, the experimentation is accomplished, at the same time, the HRT reached 5h, the refluent flux was 1.4L/h and removal rate of COD was 84.7%. It is also found that the anaerobic granular sludge disintegrated seriously in the test, particle size showed a narrowing trend and a large number of fragments fell and suspended in reactor. As a result, the SS concentration of out-flow water fluctuated largely throughout the experimentation. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The water flowing into the sand basin is generally disordered, which is unfavorable to the settlement of sediment. In order to adjust flow field to be favorable, we set an adjusting flow board in the head of settling basin to change flow state. Adjusting flow board regulates and controls the current through holes of different apertures on itself. Then, the water flowing through the adjusting flow board produces flow head loss. Therefore, the turbulence and power of the water flow are weakened.

AB Urban forests have important role on the human habitats including the environmental, social and economic aspects. But the accelerated land consumption and land abuse are very universal today, the urban forests are faced to serious threaten. It is the time to find a new and effective theory and method which is used to guide the urban forests planning, construction and management. Green Infrastructure (GI) theory and practice have roots in planning and conservation efforts that started a hundred and fifty years ago in America. Now, it was mature and became an important item and method to solving the contradiction between urban and rural construction and environment protection in America. GI is a network which is composed of "hubs" and "links", it can play an important role at a broad 'landscape scale', from urban to rural, from site/parcel, regional/local to landscape. In the case study presented in this paper, the Cecil County GI planning has contained four contents: Cecil County Water Quality Maintenance and Enhancement Analysis, Cecil County GI Ecosystem Services Assessment, Cecil County GI Network Design and Cecil County GI Implementation Quilt. By the case study, it can be seen that GI could be a new method for urban forest planning, constructing and managing. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The rapid growth of Chinese economy has tremend-ously stimulated the expansion of energy consumption. The structure of energy consumption in China is featured with the coal domination. Air pollution is becoming increasingly severe and causes enormous economic losses. As a result, we are confronted with the extremely arduous task to balance energy consumption and environmental protection. In order to avoid the situation that its rampant environmental pollution problem will worsen before it gets better, Chinese government has put high emphasis on the problem. The efforts made by Chinese government, including energy consumption structure improve-ment and control measures to air pollution, have been introduced and discussed in this paper. China possesses very abundant renewable energies such as wind, solar, geothermal and tidal. Applications of renewable energies, especially solar energy, can coordinate and improve the relationship between energy consumption and environmental protection. Therefore, Chinese government should make more efforts to set up priority of development for renewable energies. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, a two-dimensional modified Leslie-Gower-type predator-prey system with discrete time-delay is considered. Firstly, basic dynamical properties of non-delayed and delayed model system within deterministic environment, including local stability of the positive equilibrium point and the existence of Hopf bifurca-tion in the system is briefly recalled. Next, the stability and direction of Hopf bifurcation is determined by applying the normal form theory and the center manifold argument. Finally, this paper proposes the stochastic delay differential equation model to study the effect of environmental driving forces on the dynamical behavior. The stochastic model is extension of the delayed model by incorporating Gaussian white noise terms into the growth equations of both prey and predator species. And the calculation of population fluctuation intensity (variance) for prey and predator species is carried out by Fourier trans -forms method for stochastic delay differential equation model.

AB Farm-forest ecotone proves to be ecologically sensitive areas, where there is obvious change from environmental gradient. The landscape characteristic is mainly influenced by elevation, slope and human activities. Taking Mudanjiang in Heilongjiang Province as an example, this paper analyzes spatial-temporal distribution of ecological potential power in elevation and slope by the technology of GIS and RS, and the method of trend surface analysis. The results showed that dynamic process of land for agriculture and forestry had a direct impact on the change rate and direction of landscape characteristics in Mudanjiang. Trend surface analysis on ecological potential power can conclude that gradient change of landscape was concentrated in low-altitude and high-slope region from 1976 to 1986, on the contrary, mainly concentrated in the high-altitude and low-slope region from 1986 to 1996 and concentrated in the medium-altitude and medium-slope region in 1996-2006. Thus, the prominence of landscape gradient change distributed in the regions where there are frequent human activities. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE energy intensity; efficiency; intensity
AB Energy intensity is an important indicator to evaluate the coordination of energy-economy-environment system, so reducing energy intensity has become one of the greatest challenges of economy development. In order to study the relation between energy intensity and influential factors of energy intensity in China, a regression equation is used in this paper, using the method of stepwise regression analysis. By introducing the data of real GDP, total energy consumption and energy consumption mix, all data over the period 1990-2008, the regression equation can rationally simulate the energy intensity. Empirical results show that energy structure and energy conversion efficiency have a great impact on energy intensity. In the future, we should raise R&D expenditure on energy technology accounted for the proportion of GDP, optimize energy Structure, upgrade the industry structure and develop the new energy. As the regression equation has a very good simulation results, it can be used to forecast energy intensity of China. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In order to illustrate the urgency of developing low-carbon economy in Liaoning Province, we built a regression equation, using the data of real GDP, natural disasters losses and industrial pollutant emissions, all data over the period 2000-2008. Empirical result directly shows that the intensity of carbon dioxide emissions and the industrial emissions have a great impact on the ecological environment in China. By an effective contrast, we can indirectly prove that the tremendous potential destruction on environment caused by the energy consumption of Liaoning Province, China. Obviously, developing low-carbon economy should become the important project of twelfth five years plan in Liaoning Province. We should educe carbon dioxide emissions, and call upon people to try to reduce "carbon" emission in life and production. We need to transform the mode of economic development, promote structural adjustment of economy and save resources and energy. In addition, we must establish an energy-saving consumption mode, build up energy-saving industrial structure and growth pattern, eliminate highly energy-consuming industry, develop recycling economy and comprehensive utilization, as well as reduce the industrial energy-consuming level.

AB Many studies on tourist carrying capacity (TCC) at present are concentrating on ecological protection. The determination of TCC should consider the supply capacity of basic facilities in resort as well as ecosystems, such as transport vehicles, hotels and restaurants. In this paper we will introduce an evaluating index which is called "level of service" (LOS) to represent the utilization of basic facilities, and develop a function of LOS and the number of tourists. Calculation model of TTC is derived corresponding to critical value of LOS. Then from the view of ecological protection, the other TTC model is developed according to the size of tourism area and maximum tourist density parameters. Optimal TTC equals the minor of the values calculated from the two TTC models. Lastly, YunTai resort, a World Geology Park in HeNan province is used as example to explain the model. Results show that carrying capacity of LOS is 8511 and smaller than ecological carrying capacity of 11730. Measures should be taken to promote the LOS for tourists.

AB Slope stability is mainly affected by external factors and internal factors in which parameters of rock material as the main internal factors impact significantly on the slope stability. Although NLSSR(Non-linear strength reduction technology) is used more and more wide in the slope stability, but there are still many disputes at present. According to the existing defects of NLSSR, firstly, this paper analyzes the slope stability considering the deformation parameters strength reduction of rock mass. The results indicated that the safety factor and slip plane of slope are all close to the results of limit equilibrium theory. Then the sensitivity analysis of rock mass parameters is further made. The results showed that: 1. The deformation parameters have little effect on the slope stability, taking the slip surface and displacement at failure of slope into consideration, so it is necessary to synchronously reduce the deformation parameters when doing the NLSSR. 2. The slope safety factor increases with the increasing of material parameters m, s, UCS(Uniaxial compressive strength), and the three increases are almost the same extent. 3. The material parameter a has a significant effect on slope stability, the slope safety factor decreases exponentially with the increasing of parameter a. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A simple and sensitive method for the speciation, separation and preconcentration of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) in environmental water was developed. The procedure presented based on two forms of chromium show different adsorption capacities on the silica gel G loaded nano-barium strontium titanate(GBST) at different pH values, that is, Cr (III) selectively retained at pH 7-14, but Cr(VI) can't be adsorbed. Whereas Cr (VI) retained at pH 1, but Cr(III) can't be adsorbed. Hence complete separation of the two forms of chromium is possible. Retained Cr(III) and Cr(VI) were eluted with 1 mol.L-1 HCl and 1 mol.L-1 NaOH, respectively. The Cr(III) and Cr(VI) concentration was measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The method was successfully applied for the speciation of chromium in environmental water samples with successfully results. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The study on non-point source pollution is a key and difficult issue in the research on water environment pollution. The river water quality model QUAL2E and the principal component analysis & factor analysis (PCA & FA) are used combinedly to study the apportionment of point and non-point source loads. The river water quality model QUAL2E is a stream dispersion mass transfer equation, which also includes source and leakage resulting from biochemical degradation and river branch. PCA & FA is used to evaluate pollutant sources at different river sections in dry and wet seasons. In this paper, Shaanxi Reach of the Jinghe River is taken as an example, and the river water quality model QUAL2E is adopted, combining with the evaluating results of water quality obtained by PCA & FA, to calculate point and non-point source loads of ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen as the nitrogen nutrient indexes respectively in dry and wet seasons from 2002 to 2007. It is demonstrated that the calculation result of nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) is satisfactory, while that of ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) isn't. This is consistent with the results of PCA & FA, that is, NO3--N can be associated with point source discharge of domestic sewage, etc. in dry seasons and non-point source pollution generated by precipitation in wet seasons, whereas NH4+-N is discharged from point sources all over the year, and its unsatisfactory calculation result is due to the instability of point source discharge. This kind of method provides reliable results on non-point source pollution caused by storm runoff. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Wood carbon sequestration could be characterized effectively by wood microstructure based on wood microscopic image processing. Growing environment is one of the important factors affecting wood microstructure. The study of growing environment could provide a scientific theory basis for drawing up cultural operations. The results show that the more percentage of cell tissue of late wood, the less proportion of tracheal tissue, the more proportion of xylon, then the better effect of carbon sequestration of Populus ussuriensis. Intermediate cutting and meadow albic bleached soil are more beneficial to carbon sequestration of Populus ussuriensis. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The main objective of the present work was to examine the effect of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) on bioavailability of Lingwu jujube (Zizyphus jujuba Mill.) during the period of shelf life. Fruits were exposed to 0.5 mu LL-1 of 1-MCP for 24 h at room temperature, and fruits were held up to 8 days and assessed for quality during storage, membrane permeability, malondialdehyde (MDA), and using an in vitro digestion system that simulated the physiochemical changes that occurred in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The differences in fruit firmness, soluble solid content (SSC), and membrane permeability with 1-MCP treatment were manifested during shelf life period. MDA, an indicator of lipid peroxidation caused by reactive oxygen species, increased during shelf life and the contents were significantly lower in fruit treated with 1-MCP than control samples. The results indicated 1-MCP was an effective tool for quality improvement and extension of shelf life in jujubes, and showed that the bioavailability of tissues was tightly related to the quality of fruits and the simulated digestion appeared to be an efficient tool for studying the bioavailability from fruits and vegetables.

AB A new method of preconcentration with barium-strontium titanate based on glass fiber filter(BBST) combined with flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) was proposed for the determination of trace heavy metal ions, included Mn(II), Cu2+, Ni2+ and Ag+, in environmental water. The optimum experimental parameters for preconcentration of the heavy metals studied, such as pH, flow rate and volume, eluent and coexisting ions, have been investigated. The results showed that Mn(II), Cu2+, Ni2+ and Ag+ could be quantitatively retained by the BBST in the pH range of 5-10, and then eluted completely with 2 mol.L-1 HNO3. The detection limits of this method for Mn(II), Cu2+, Ni2+ and Ag+ were 0.021 mu g.L-1, 0.029 mu g.L-1, 0.16 mu g.L-1 and 0.038 mu g.L-1 with an enrichment factor of 50, respectively. The method has been applied to the simultaneous determination of trace amounts of Mn(II), Cu2+, Ni2+ and Ag+ in environmental water with satisfactory results. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Time-series analysis theory is applied to analyze and perdict the dynamic variation of groundwater in the area of Longkeng water source in Songyuan of Jilin Province, China. The trend component of groundwater level dynamic variation in picked up by polynomial calibration, the periodic component is extracted by spectrum analysis and the stochastic component is simulated by using auto regression (AR) model. Finally, a forecasting model is established through linear superposition of the three components. The simulating precision of the model is verified in this paper. According to the simulation analysis, groundwater level seasonal and secular variation and the regularity characteristics are revealed. The prediction indicates that a continuing decline of groundwater level exists in Longkeng water source area which must be controlled in time. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In order to investigate energy demands and CO2 emissions from production activities in Jiangsu Province in detail, we analyzed the direct and indirect amounts of energy demands and CO2 emissions by 26 sectors in Jiangsu Province in 2007. An environmental input-output table (EIOT) was constructed based on the 2007 monetary input-output table of Jiangsu Province. And each sector's energy demands and CO2 emissions were treated as external multipliers. Subsequently, each sector's direct and indirect effects on energy demands and CO2 emissions in 2007 are studied. It is indicated that Jiangsu Province should focus on three points in future development: industrial structure changes, technology development and renewable energy utilization. At last, future work for the EIOT was discussed. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper deals with a latent failure study on the low-level electrostatic discharge (ESD) stresses on microelectric device. A series of low-level ESD stresses were imposed on microwave low noise transistor 2SC3356 using the human body model (HBM). It is shown that ESD stresses, even at a level below the failure threshold, can impact the device lifetime by creating latent defects, and the device impressed by lower ESD stressing was easier to occur latent failure.

AB In this study, coagulation features and molecular weight (MW) distribution dissolved organic matter (DOM) of combined sewer overflow (CSO) wastewater were investigated. Ferric chloride (FeCl3) and Polyaluminium Chloride (PAC) were employed in the coagulation process. The results showed that both FeCl3 and PAC were effective for remove Turbidity and TP, the removal efficiency were all above 90% when the dosages was reasonable; optimal removal efficiency of COD were appropriate of 60-70%; but the removal efficiency of NH4+-N and TN were 10-20% only. The comparison results of removal efficiency of COD, Turbidity, NH4+-N, TN and TP in different concentration of raw wastewater with the same dosages of FeCl3 and PAC were also investigated. The results showed that water quality of raw wastewater was one of the influential parameters for the optimized treatment of the wastewater. The MW distribution of DOM of the raw wastewater and coagulated samples was analysis by gel filtration chromatography (GFC) and ultrafiltration technology. Compared with the initial wastewater, coagulated samples had much narrower distributions of MW. DOM fraction MW>30kDa can be removed by both FeCl3 and PAC. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The packaging rationality of two kinds of milk packaging, one of which is plastic made from polyethylene and the other is composite material made from laminating Al/PE/Paper, was evaluated and compared adopting the approach of LCA, respectively. Firstly, the hierarchy structure of evaluation index system was established, taking its practical function, acceptable environment and feasible economic roles into consideration. Then weight of each item in the evaluation system was obtained using analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) was used for final rationality evaluation. Combined with LCA, AHP and FCE, a rationality evaluation method was developed for milk packages comprehensively considering environmental, economic and functional factors, and the rationality of two kinds of milk packages were evaluated as case study. The results indicated that the composite package was more feasible than plastic packaging and would be a sustainable choice for milk package if improvements were made on its environmental and economic aspects. The method was proved simple and feasible for rationality evaluation of package products. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ecological restoration is an effective way of solving natural resource problems and also energy development problems. Ecological restoration has grown astoundingly in the past three decades. Our aims are to detect the evolution of research and engineering practice of ecological restoration, to find the focus changes in this field over time, to identify the relationships between the topics discussed in the field, and to sense the opportunities to match new changes. We conducted a statistical and bibliometrical analysis on published articles in ISI Web of Science database by using EndNoteX, SPSS, and RefViz. Materials published (n=4,862) between Jan., 1981 and Jun., 2009 were used in the analysis. Our results show that (1) Three distinct stages (1981-1996, 1997-2002, 2003-2009) were identified in temporal evolution of ecological restoration with total article numbers 59, 1403, and 3400, respectively. (2) The distributions of articles in three stages show that research topics extensively expanded in the second stage and research contents diversified in the third stage. (3) After analyzing associations, we established a framework that show ecological restoration research and practice has mainly focused on terrestrial ecosystem (main element is soil) and aquatic ecosystem (main element is water). Our opinion is that the trend of ecological restoration went from practices to science which covers a spectrum of quite different fields, including managemental, political, and technical aspects. Publication of diverse ecological restoration studies should be encouraged to speed up the transformation of this discipline. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The aim of this paper is to put forward a strategic framework of wetland preservation and management based on Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Information Systems (IS) in China. After analyzing the past and current wetland management in China, there were four problems identified existing in wetland management in China: a lack of wetland inventory, a lack of professional management, a delay in information online, and a lack of public participation in decision making. Thus, there is great need for establishing a conservation and management framework for both natural wetland and constructed wetland. A brief literature review is supplemented by a number of more detailed applications illustrating various GIS techniques which may be of use to the applied environmental issues or natural resources. GIS and IS could provide a platform to incorporate the complexities of the spatial data of all kinds of wetlands into the wetland inventory. The information collected through wetland inventories is essential for sustainable wetland management. Finally, the authors addressed the structure of the management system and put forward a strategy by online access that both benefit for decision making and public participation.

AB In the marine industry there has always been immense research interest in maximizing accuracy of fishery forecasting. The fishery knowledge have a great impact on the accuracy, so this paper proposes a new knowledge discovery and representation model for obtaining and representing fishery knowledge, which takes a 3 step process. Firstly, it extracts static knowledge from database by SVM classifier and fuzzy classifier. Secondly, it uses extension data mining method to transfer static knowledge into dynamic knowledge. Thirdly, it establishes an ontology knowledge base by utilizing a mapping mechanism between the dynamic knowledge and ontology. Using the proposed model building procedure, the authors implemented a prototype system for fishery forecasting. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and efficient.

AB CH4 pyrolysis and CH4-CO2 reforming to produce syngas was carried out in a quartz tubular reactor over blank and carbonaceous catalyst. Material balance analysis of C atom was conducted according to the calculated H. The gas composition was detected by an on line gas chromatograph with FPD and PID detector. It was found that CH4 pyrolysis decomposed into carbon and H-2. For CH4-CO2 reforming, firstly CH4 decomposed into carbon and H-2, the carbon then reacts with carbon monoxide to form carbon dioxide. As a comparison, blank tests were also performed. The results showed that the carbonaceous catalyst greatly decreased the initial reaction temperature (about decreased 50 degrees C), and promoted CH4 conversion. From the material balance analysis of C atom, it can be found that the mass of carbonaceous catalyst reduce during the carbon dioxide reforming reaction of methane. It indicated that the gasification of carbonaceous materials by CO2 takes place during the synthesis process. The consumption kinetics parameters of carbonaceous materials were determined by an overall unreacted shrinking core model. The apparent activation energy of consumption carbonaceous materials was more than 230kJ/mol during CH4-CO2 reforming. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Large stacker operation is a major source for powder on port. The previous studies on the patterns of generating coal powder on port need to be updated with applying modern large-scale machine. In this study, we aim to (1) design a model of large bulk stacker for wind tunnel test simulation; (2) unify the coal powder emission model based on formulas analysis and wind tunnel experiment; (3) establish a mathematical model of the large stacker operation powder emission pattern on port. The results show that (1) models of large bulk stacker were tested with tunnel test simulation; (2) the coal powder emission models were unified based on formulas analysis and wind tunnel experiment; (3) a mathematical model of the large stacker operation powder emission pattern on port was established. This model is fit for large stacker operation on port based on formulas review analysis, wind tunnel experiments and statistical analysis. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In order to figure out the effect of the initial pH of solutions on electrochemical oxidation, a commercial dimensionally stable anode (DSA) was employed for degradation of organic pollutants tetracycline and Orange II. It was observed that the process of electrochemical oxidation was highly pH dependent in a wide pH range from pH 2.0 to 12.0. Acidic and alkaline conditions were found to be especially favorable for the organics oxidation, but the lowest decolorization efficiency and COD removal was proved to be at pH 7.0. The use of NaCl was more effective for organics degradation than Na2SO4 because chlorine and hypochlorite ions were generated and involved in oxidation process. The effect of solution pH was basically resulted from the generation of oxidizing species other than the electrostatic attraction, which can influence the adsorption of organic pollutants onto the anode to a large extent.

AB Activated sludge plays a very important position in biological wastewater treatment process, mathematical models and computer technology have been applied in activated sludge process widely. After fitting the experimental data and developing microbial growth kinetics model, the identification model based on biological wastewater treatment process characteristics became hot topic. This changed activated sludge process design into research of the dynamics activated sludge process for the target of high efficiency of low-power. Then, corresponding activated sludge process commercial software was developed. The first activated sludge process software based on ASM1 model, SSSP (simulation of single sludge process), was developed in 1988. With the modeling advanced development, various activated sludge process commercial software were developed, such as EFOR, STOAT, SASS PRo, DSP and GPS-X. In this paper the activated sludge software are introduced and some advises are proposed. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Biofilm growth within a water distribution system could lead to operational problems such as pipe corrosion and water quality deterioration. Three sites were selected for biofilm sample collection. A new method was developed using an ultrasound probe (sonicator) to remove the biofilms from the coupon for analysis while never hurt the bacterial on it. From the results of biofilm samples, it was found that the biofilm consisted of water, organic and non-organic materials. The results of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations shown that cocci bacteria, grouped as a cluster, were seen together with other material. High HPC values in some biofilm samples illustrated that the relevant sample sites had a high potential for biofilm growth. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper reviews the present development of environmental emergency in China that involves legislative framework, regulations and technical support system. Through the analysis of actual case, these deficiencies and problems existing in action of environmental emergency are pointed out. In the countermeasures, the punishment and fine ceiling for environmental violations should be raised by revising clauses, and fees about handling, inspection, restoring and compensation for pollution incidents should be put into the law system, and environmental protection departments should be the leadership to improve emergency response efficiency, and the technical support system should be established to build a series of technical guidelines, norms and work manuals around three procedures that include prevention and monitoring before incident, response and handling in incident and assessment and restore after incident.

AB In order to assess the vehicle-induced pollution at highway toll stations in actual atmospheric conditions, a numerical simulation method based on CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) was proposed. A traffic micro simulation model and a three-dimensional CFD model were established according to the actual characteristics of toll stations. In the first model, the average travel time of all vehicles was calculated considering the variation of traffic volume and toll collection procedure. As a result, the pollutant emission source strength was obtained. In the second model, the change of air flow and pollutant dispersion condition could be simulated in consideration of the ambient conditions including wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, topography, etc. A case study of the Wutong Toll Station was given and the results between simulation and filed measurement were similar.

AB Cleaning strategies for algae-fouled ultrafiltration membrane were investigated in pilot-scale experiments. Comparison of five different physical cleaning modes indicated that backwashing followed by forward flushing was more effective for flux recovery, and combining hydraulic cleaning with air sparge could improve the permeate flux recovery percent up to 87.49%. Cleaning frequency should be taken for the concentration of foulants and cleaning methods. To maximize flux recovery for the algae-fouled membrane, on-line chemical cleaning was studied, the permeate flux reduced only 5.37% after over 240h filtration duration.

AB This paper presents a theoretical and experimental framework based on dynamics to model and analyze energy efficient distributed storage systems. A dynamics analysis model based on Cellular Automata (CA), called DSSCA, is proposed to evaluate distributed Object-based Storage (OBS) systems. DSSCA can have either finite or infinite size with high scalability. Each node represents an Object-based Device (OSD) and can communicate with the neighbor nodes autonomously and perform tasks independently without a centralized control. Moreover, simple energy efficient rules can be adopted by each node and then global behaviors emerge from the evolution and interaction of multiple individuals. To evaluate the intelligence of the system to changes of external behaviors, we proposed a heuristic power-aware mechanism. Each node has a write request queue, the length of which changes dynamically with access intensity and node throughput. In the simulation, we observe an appropriate threshold could both guarantee performance and save power. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the increasing demand of global petroleum, viewing from oil tanker "Prestige" stranding to the latest "Deepwater Horizon Drilling rig" explosion, a variety of catastrophic oil spill accidents at sea, particularly ship's oil spill, has brought severe hazard to marine ecological environment and human society. Through the sample selected from the case database of historical ships' oil spill accidents in China, this paper establishes an artificial neural network model for damage assessment of marine oil spill pollution, and writes special program to train and simulate the Back-Propagation Neural Networks with MATLAB toolbox. The experimental results indicate that the damage assessment of oil spill by Back-Propagation Neural Networks is objectively precise and reliable, so as to provide an effective assessment method to claim for compensation caused by ship's oil spill accidents.

AB To evaluate the inherent biodegradability of light greywater for the bathe products, 8 kinds of shampoos and 3 kinds of soaps were chosen. The Zehn-Wellens test was conducted to examine the biodegradability of the greywater for these bathe products. Results showed that there was little biodegradable difference between the different bathe products we selected. Although the biochemical oxygen demand to chemical oxygen demand (BOD5/COD) of all of the greywater was less than 0.2, the biodegradation of these bathe products was rounded to the full percent after 28 days operation. Therefore, it was suggested that the method of using BOD5/COD to evaluate biodegradability might not be as accurate as we considered. Moreover, the molecular weight distributions of two typical kinds of greywater were analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). With the operation of the test from day 1 to day 28, the molecular weight distributions were getting narrower, and finally the fractions of the molecular weight below 10(5)Da accounted for 69.8% and 77.8% in Run 4 and Run 11, respectively. So, the greywater can be biodegraded to small molecules which were not harm to environment. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Construction industry has contributed a lot to the economic development during 30 years of reform and opening up in China. Because construction industry is typically an energy-intensive and resource-intensive industry, environmental impact situations are necessary to be found, especially for the purpose of improving performance of construction industry in China. In this paper, based on the data of National Bureau of Statistics of China and National Development and Reform Commission, characteristics of construction industry production have been analyzed. Then, the problem of estimation of environmental impact of construction industry is mainly converted into the total CO2 emissions during construction programme. Because of the dynamic nature of construction industry development and the specificity of sample data, leading to estimation of environmental impact difficulty, so a intelligent estimation model based on least squares support vector machines is presented to improve the prediction process. The proposed model takes advantage of LS-SVMs ability to solve the problem with small samples and nonlinear regression. Furthermore, the proposed approach is shown more accurate for prediction in the case of real-word application. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID IMPACT ACOUSTICS
AB In solid waste treatment plants the waste gets crushed, classified and sorted. Among these processes the sorting is the determining step for recycling and reuse. Sensor based sorting technology has been developed and utilized for sorting of polymer ingredients in waste mixtures. One of the still remaining problem lies within the sorting of black polymer materials like plastics and rubbers which are very difficult to be sorted by conventional visual sensors. In this paper a new multi-sensor technology for black plastics sorting by using impact acoustic was introduced, since different plastics have different structures and acoustic emissions when an impact is given. A pilot multi-sensor sorting system which consists of a 3-dimensional visual sensor and an acoustic sensor was also built for this research and 3 kinds of plastics were tested. During the experiments the sizes of tested plastic pieces were measured by visual sensor and the acoustic emissions were captured by acoustic sensor. The signal processing and feature extraction of the visual and acoustic signals were realized by virtual instruments. The extracted features were used for classification of different plastic materials. Feature extraction by using power spectrum of each impact yield good result. This research provides a new approach for automatic sorting of black plastic polymers. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   progress; Granger causality test
AB Energy prices have large impacts upon production costs and therefore economic growth. For an industrialized country with very tight energy supply constraints, increasing energy costs may drive the firms to seek for technological progress and innovation to compete internationally. Using the Japanese monthly data of 1975-2009, this study tests the assumption of endogenous cost-driven technological progress. We identify a long-run equilibrium cointegrating relationship among the Japanese industrial production, energy prices, export volumes and export prices. Although energy prices are negatively associated with Japanese industrial production in static equilibrium, the empirical results of Granger causality tests show that an increase in domestic energy costs has significantly positive effects on Japan's industrial production as well as on export volumes and prices, in both short-run and long-run. We document that there exists an endogenous technological progress driven by energy costs in Japan. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper studied the destruction efficiency of nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide under different humidity of flue gas in a wire-to-plate type corona plasma reactor. The results indicate that humidity of flue gas increased the removal rate of water soluble pollutants such as NO2 and SO2, but had little influence on the removal of NO; in addition, ammonia sulfide advance the conversion of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide.

The factors on oil removal effectives were studied through changing the pH, ethanol and SDS concentration. The results of experiments indicate that the elimination rate of diesel oil in soil increases with the decreasing of IFT of oil-solution. Water washing of a diesel-polluted soil could eliminate up to 11.6% of diesel oil. When the pH of solution is 8.0, the elimination effect is the most obvious and the elimination rate is 38.2%. The elimination rate reaches 80.7% when the volume concentration of ethanol is 70%. The elimination rate reaches 35.6% with 4CMC solution leaching. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Corporate Environmental Supervisor System is established referring to Japan's public pollution prevention manager system and combining the actual situation in our country. Looking at the existing environmental regulatory system, China has built a relatively perfect monitoring system for corporate environmental pollution control, but the internal corporate environmental management is weak, corporate social and environmental responsibility not strong, internal corporate environmental management organizational system unperfected and the rights, obligations and responsibilities of corporate environmental managers indeterminate. The establishment of the corporate environmental supervisor system helps and guides enterprises to designate an environmental management director filled by the owners of enterprises and an internal corporate environmental management system consisting of at-work environmental supervisors, and the supervision and inspection of all the aspects of production are conducted by the environment supervisors who grasp environmental laws and regulations and are familiar with the production technology and pollution discharge situation of their enterprises to extend the corporate pollution prevention from the end-treatment to the whole production process. This will effectively promote the enterprises to enhance the subject responsibility and comprehensively reduce the polluting emission. In this paper, the Necessity of China's environmental supervisor system, the theoretical framework and practice are discussed. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Poultry manure, municipal solid waste were composted in a static vessel to testify the practicability of aerobic co-composting with C/N ratio 15, 20 and 25. Total nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen transformation were measured during composting. C/N ratios of three treatments all tended to decrease and it was remarkable at the treatment of PMC25 during composting. The total nitrogen reduced gradually with the composting time. The lower the C/N ratio was, the higher the final total nitrogen concentration has. Main way of nitrogen loss was volatilization in the form of ammonia originated from ammonium. The main period of nitrogen loss was during the thermophilic composting time, at the same time, the NH4+-N decreased. The NO3--N increased after thermophilic composting time. The concentration of usable nitrogen was increased after composting. The experimental results showed that composting with low C/N ratios is feasible. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB After the white-rot fungi were immobilized in different ways, not only was its biological activity increased significantly, but also its ability to pure wastewater was enhanced a great deal. In this experiment, white-rot fungi immobilized by polyvinyl alcohol-sodium alginate, bacterial cellulose dynamic adsorption and bacterial cellulose static adsorption, was used to deal with malachite green dye wastewater. The results showed that the most effective way to pure the malachite green wastewater was white-rot fungi immobilization by the bacterial cellulose static adsorption. The color removal rate remained more than 93% on the former six groups of wastewater, which was increased 3% more than free bacteria. It exceeded the other two methods in efficiency and stability of color removal. As an immobilized carrier, bacterial cellulose is biodegradable, immobilized operation simply, etc and applicable to industrial production and this method has a great potential.

The result showed that H1 which was immobilized by natural BC treated nitrate-rich and ammonium-rich wastewater, the efficiencies of TN removal were 50.98% and 60.2%, respectively. While H1 was immobilized by modified BC had higher removal effects than natural BC, were up to 74.3% and 75.75%. Because the organic matter which was added to BC in the process of modification, the removal of CODcr was slightly lower than the natural membrane. It was found that modification can improve toughness of BC, overcame the shortcoming of easy degradation, and which was convenient to recycle H1. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Based on the Navier-Stokes equations and the k-epsilon turbulent flow model, the numerical simulation was carried out for the water flows by using CFD program FLUENT. A new corrugated board structure in the oxidation ditch is proposed and the flow pattern and flow velocity distribution is calculated by using numerical simulation. The extended guide wall and the non-extended guide wall are also compared by using numerical simulation. The results show that vortex behind the non-extended guide wall in oxidation ditch was the largest, and vortex behind the flat guide wall was the smallest. Seen from the perspective of reducing vortex, the velocity distribution of water flow in corrugated board oxidation ditch was the best. The new corrugated board structure will reduce the low water flow areas behind wall in oxidation ditch and improve the role of eliminating sludge deposition. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Mechanism of activated carbon desulfurization under the condition of desorption by water is researched according to the result of adsorbing performance experiment using different adsorbents. A new theory is proposed to explain the oxidation process of SO2 and the formation of the effective adsorption sites when water exists. Argument is presented that effective adsorption sites are produced only at a certain reaction space that can provide appropriate distances and configurations between reactant molecules. Analysis and estimation of reaction space in the whole reaction process are done on the basis of Zawadzki's desulfurization theory. Studies show that the aperture distribution of adsorbent is a crucial factor in the adsorption process and effective adsorbing reaction space will generate when aperture width is over 1.0nm. Results of this study will lead a correct choice of the suitable activated carbon for flue gas desulfurization and effectively increase activated carbon's adsorption capacity for SO2.

AB During construction of reinforced concrete box arch ring cast-in-place with aid of arch centering, the environmental temperature variations usually have a huge impact on the arch centering and arch ring, including the displacement variations of arch centering and the stress variations of bars. In this paper, the finite element method was employed to study the effect of environmental temperature variations on the force and deformation of arch centering and the stress in the concrete arch ring. The results show that environmental temperature variations have little or nothing influence on the deformation of arch centering and great influence on the stress in arch centering and concrete. The stress in lower chords around arch crown increases and the stress in upper chords decreases with environmental temperature rising, which causing the stress in arch centering more uniform and compressive stress in the whole cross-section of arch ring. Meanwhile, the stress in bars around arch foot (that is high stress area) increases significantly and the tensile stress may come forth in the arch ring boot with environmental temperature dropping. The tensile stress may even cause cracks. Therefore, temperature enhancement is beneficial for the arch centering and arch ring, and on the contrary, temperature reduction is baleful.

AB In bridges, seismic pounding may result in considerable damage during severe ground motions, such as localized girder damage, damage to shear key and abutments, and even contribute to the collapse of bridge spans. A numerical method had been developed. The paper mainly verified the numerical method through the comparison the numerical results and the experimental results. Two testes-steel-steel pounding and concrete-concrete pounding-are employed. The influence of the time step length on the numerical results is studied. From the parameter analysis, we find that time step length has much influence on impact force calculation and little influence on the displacement and velocity calculation and the time step Delta t = 0.0002s can meet the computing needs in these cases, but the value is not fixed. The time step length may be different when the parameters of impact bodies change. The time step length can be determined by comparing. In this paper, the overall prediction of the relative impact velocities is consistent with the experimental data. It shows that the numerical method is accurate and can be used in the engineering applications. In addition, it is noted that pounding may lead to considerable change of the structural response during the earthquake. So we should pay much attention to the influence of earthquake-induced pounding on the bridge seismic response. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Travel speed is an important parameter to discriminate traffic states, and proposed a new estimation method of link travel speed based on downstream loop detectors of road section. Traffic states have the characteristics of fuzziness, so fuzzy comprehensive evaluation was used in the proposed method, and developed a multi-parameter and multi-level fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method.

AB The environment and human serve as elaborate hosts to microbes, including a diversity of commensal and pathogenic bacteria that contribute to both health and disease. 16S rRNA genes are used for community profiling, or determining the abundance of each kind of microbe. The aim of our study is to analyze the similarity among microbial communities on the functional state, after assigned 16S rRNA sequences from all microbial communities to species. It's an important addition to the species-level relationship between two compared communities, and can quantify their differences in function. To accomplish this aim, we downloaded all functional annotation data of microbiota from related datasets. It's developed to identify the functional distribution and the significantly enriched functional categories of microbial communities. Exploration of the function relationship between two sets of species assemblages will be a key result of microbiome studies and may provide new insights into assembly of a wide range of ecosystems.

AB As an important pillar industry of national economy, the real estate industry is usually the first one of important industries that governments implement macroeconomic control. Because it has its own characteristics, such as long chain, wide ramifications and strong promotion, the rapid development of real estate industry produces different degree of chain reaction about its related industry. Based on the input-output model, the paper makes quantitative analysis about the correlation of the real estate industry and its related industries in JiLin Province, reveals the variation of them, has important significance of promoting the coordinated development between real estate industry and other related industries, and provide the beneficial reference for formulating real estate development planning and economic policy of JiLin Province.

AB The impact of elevated temperature on microbial community structure and performance during anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) treating thermal-hydrolyzed sewage sludge at temperatures ranging from 35-53 degrees C was investigated. The performance of the ASBR reactor took a different change in the three different processes of the step-wise temperature increment. There was a slight effect on the digestion process between the first step-increase (from 35 degrees C to 40 degrees C)and final step-increase (from 47 degrees C to 53 degrees C). The second step-increase (from 40 degrees C to 47 degrees C) resulted in a severe disturbance. At the temperature of 53 degrees C, the average daily gas production, specific methane production (CH4/CODinfluent) of the ASBR treating thermal-hydrolyzed sewage sludge were 2.038L/d, 188.8mL/g, respectively. Microbial community analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) revealed that distinct bacteria and archaea consortia were supported at each temperature. Temperature served as a selective pressure for microbial community development during the treatment. There was a gradual shift in bacteria and archaea consortia as temperature varied.

AB Colloid mobilization has been shown to facilitate the movement of contaminants through the subsurface. Knowledge of deposition and release of colloids is requisite to predicting the contaminant transport. This paper focuses on colloid deposition and release under different ionic strength in saturated porous media and a model is developed to simulate experimental results. Our work demonstrates that release of colloids was sensitive to the ionic strength, which caused varies spatial and temporal variation of release rate. Traditional One-site model could not describe steep ascending of detached colloids. Dynamic one-site model and two-site model reflect the heterogeneity induced by perturbation of solute concentration. Two-site model was appropriate experimentally and theoretically by dividing the solid phase into two fractions. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID LOAD-CARRYING CAPACITY; STEEL ARCHES
AB During construction of reinforced concrete box arch ring cast-in-place with aid of arch centering, the water flow usually has a huge impact on the arch centering and arch ring, if the construction period coincides with the flood. Excessive impact may cause out-plane buckling of the arch centering, resulting in extremely serious consequences. In the paper, the finite element method was employed to study the impact of water flow on the centering during construction with two different construction schemes for a long span arch bridge. The results show that transverse displacement will occur in arch crown when arch ring subjected to the action of water flow. Different displacement will occur with different construction schemes. The construction scheme with a small transverse displacement should be chosen to ensure the construction safety program. This construction scheme has a feature that the lateral stiffness of the arch centering and arch ring is strong. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   Euclidean distance
AB Selecting process of scheme design of sacrificial shear key has been very important issue for engineer for years, because the improper selection of sacrificial shear key might cause of many problems affecting negatively on effectiveness of reliability during severe ground motions and economic rationality, construction feasibility and technical feasibility post-earthquake rehabilitation. In the paper, the fuzzy integrated evaluation is used for sacrificial shear key scheme selection problem due to the fact that it has been widely used in evaluating various kinds of multiple-criteria decision making problems in both academic researches and practices. The fuzzy statistical method was employed to statistics experts' remarks to generate the fuzzy set membership. The average weight method was proposed to determine the weights. The procedures of the proposed method were that determining the initial weights by experts mark ratings and then calculating the average of initial weights. In addition, Euclidean distance was employed to represent the deviation of scheme design from the perfect one and ultimately determine the optimum scheme. A case study was also presented to make this approach more understandable for a decision-maker(s). The sacrificial shear key scheme selection proposed by this paper can effectively solve the sacrificial shear key scheme selection problem. It is can be used in the bridge seismic design.

AB In the paper, least squares support vector machine trained by chaos particle swarm optimization (CPSO-LSSVM) is applied in the classification. Chaos particle swarm optimization algorithm is introduced to select the suitable training parameters of least squares support vector machine. That is because chaos particle swarm optimization algorithm can avoid being trapped in local optimum and gaining the global optimum quickly in the process of search by combining particle swarm optimization with chaos queues. The experimental results demonstrate that least squares support vector machine trained by chaos particle swarm optimization is best classification results in the three classification algorithms.

AB Taking a certain large water supply reservoir as example, this paper applies homa solution of lake perfect mixing attenuation model to analyze lake volume, lake staying time and degradation coefficient's effect on water environment capacity of total nitrogen and total phosphorus. The elastic coefficients are used as sensitivity indicators to discuss the above three model parameters' contribution rates to environmental capacity. The contribution rates of lake volume, staying time and degradation coefficient to total nitrogen capacity are respectively 36%, 29% and 35%, and the contribution rates to total phosphorus capacity are respectively 26%, 43% and 31%. The results show that the variation of model parameters can change dramatically dilution, degradation and displace capacity, and the change will affect the total environmental capacity. From the average value of elastic coefficient, each model parameter has great contribution to total nitrogen and total phosphorus environment capacity. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The extraction of concentric rings from x-ray coherent scatter images is the key step to calculate the energy distribution curve of x-ray coherent scatter images. In this paper, the image was transformed successively into a binary image by using adaptive threshold algorithm and Mathematical Morphology methods. The effective region was extracted from the binary image in the orthogonal energy projection space. And the centroid of rings was calculated. The centroid is the circular center of ring. And pixels have same Euclidean distance to the center construct a ring. The sum of square of gray-level of pixels in a ring is the energy of the ring. Then the curve of the energy distribution was built in whole image. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The volatility of Baltic Dry Index (BDI) from the year 2007 to 2009 reflects the historical features of the world's shipping economy during the period of financial crisis. BDI in 2007 reflects the boom period of international shipping market economy. The rise and fall of volatility of BDI in 2008 shows the recession sign due to financial crisis. The reiterative uptrend of BDI in 2009 indicates the hesitated recovery of the economic crisis. The basic trend of the BDI reveals the movement trend of M, U and W shape. The aim of this paper is to valid the degree of volatility and risk of BDI by choosing the week average of BDI from the year 2007 to 2009 as empirical data, with the detailed research approach by using curve trend to make qualitative analysis and statistical principle to make volatility analysis. The conclusion is that the volatility of BDI from the year 2007 to 2009 effectively reflects the fluctuations of shipping economy and proves that BDI is an indicator to reflect high risk.

AB Nowadays, identification of environmental risk sources which need to be focused on becomes an urgent requirement in environmental risk management in industrial park. This paper proposes a conceptual assessment framework for identification of environmental risk sources, according to the characteristics of environmental risks in an industrial park. The study divided the identification process into four steps, including source analysis, receptor analysis, risk characterization and risk assessment. This risk assessment method helps to identify environmental risk sources which need to be focused on and their priority, and provide scientific foundation for security management of industrial parks and enterprises.

AB Ferric ion in catalytically oxidized liquids of cyanide tailings by NOx was separated by solvent extraction technology or precipitation method, then the separated ferric ion was reduced partially by iron. At last, two different kinds of Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared from the two kind of different ferric liquid. The particle size and magnetic properties of Fe3O4 were studied. It is concluded that Fe3O4 nanoparticles made from precipitation method is one kind of super-paramagnetic particle, with an approximately diameter of 20nm, saturate magnetization of 58.72 emu/g and surface area of 235m(2)/g, compared with those particles from the other separation method. The adsorption performance was studied by degeneration methyl orange (MO). Results show that the adsorption property of highly concentrated MO is better. The adsorption rate can achieve above 90% under 200 times of dosage, low temperature and the acidic condition. The adsorption process is the spontaneous exothermic reaction. Relationship between balanced adsorptive capacity q and the balance mass density C-e is well conformed with the Langmuir adsorption isotherms, which belongs to the monolayer adsorption.

AB The waste collection vehicle routing problems with time windows and intermediate facilities (WCVRPTW-IF) is actually belong to a well-known generalization of VRP, the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem with Inter-Depot Routes (MDVRPI), which is a combinatorial optimization problem and holds a central place in reverse logistics management. In order to improve the route compactness, which is very important in practical application, we presents a clustering-based multiple ant colony system approach called CMACS algorithm to solve CVRPTW-IF. Our CMACS possesses a new strategy to construct solutions, called clustering-based strategy, and mutation operation. Tests are conducted on two standard instances. The results show that CMACS algorithm exhibits a robust behavior and the clustering-based strategy is effective. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study the influence of Organic Loading Rate (OLR) on the formation and phosphorus removal efficiency of granular sludge was investigated in an Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR). The SBR was operated as an alternating anaerobic-aerobic cycle, and the Dissolved Oxygen (DO) concentration in the period of aerobic feast time in an SBR-cycle was maintained 1 similar to 2mg/L, the low DO concentration was obtained by reducing the air flow rate. Experiment results showed that, the sludge in the SBR was the mixture of a majority of activated sludge floc and a small quantity of round-shaped granular at the OLR of 0.482 similar to 0.986kgCOD/(m(3).d); granulation was accelerated at the early time of the OLR of 2.218 similar to 2.263kgCOD/(m(3).d), while the morphology of granules changed to an irregular shape on the end of the OLR of 2.218 similar to 2.263kgCOD/(m(3).d); then the OLR decreased to 1.113 similar to 1.182kgCOD/(m(3).d), the mature granules was cultivated successfully at this OLR, due to the combination effects of the low DO and the OLR. The OLR had also influence on efficiency of phosphorus removal, when the OLR was elevated to 2.218 similar to 2.263kgCOD/(m(3).d), competition between GAOs and PAOs was triggered. Which led to efficiency of phosphorus removal declined, and could not recovered even if the OLR was decreased to 1.113 similar to 1.182 kgCOD/(m(3).d). (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB On the Loess Plateau of China, the local people have been struggling on low incomes to guarantee their food security, and contend with some of the most serious soil erosion problems in the world. This paper discusses the application, over ten years, of an ecosystem recovery plan based on the sustainable eco-agricultural theories, introduced in the Yan'gou watershed in 1998, including three eco-agricultural construction models intended to control soil and water losses, increase agricultural production and rise income levels. The economic and eco-environmental benefits achieved during this period of reconstruction are analyzed. The evidence indicates that the combination of comprehensive measures to prevent eco-environmental degradation and the application of eco-agricultural models was appropriate. The eco-environment has been improved and the local people are now having higher incomes and much better living conditions. The application of three eco-agricultural construction models provide scientific evidence, and are exemplary illustration of what may be accomplished by investing in eco-environmental restoration and eco-agricultural construction on the Loess Plateau.

AB The immobilization of denitrifying bacteria by PVA in seawater was studied, and the effects of pH and temperature on the nitrogen removal efficiency of immobilized ball were investigated. Results showed in the appropriate environment, the nitrogen removal efficiency of immobilized balls was lower than those not immobilized denitrifying bacteria. However, when the environment was not suitable for the growth of denitrifying bacteria (eg. pH5.0, temperature 10 degrees C), the immobilized ball could increase the nitrogen removal efficiency compared with those not immobilized due to their protect effect.

AB Based on the synthetic nano-hydroxyapatite, we investigated its adsorption character of bovine serum albumin (BSA) dissolved in water by batch adsorption experiments. Results showed that many parameters would influence the protein adsorption process, including contact time, temperature, ionic strength, initial protein concentration and so on. The adsorption capacity increased with increasing contact time and established the equilibrium after 60 minutes. The amount of protein adsorption increased as the initial protein concentration and ionic strength, but decrease of the temperature resulted in the increase of protein adsorption quantity. The isotherm studies showed that the Langmuir model was the best choice to describe the protein adsorption behaviors of n-HAp at 37 degrees C. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   sewage treatment efficiency
AB Effect of filter bed temperature on sewage treatment efficiency by vermifiltration was studied by analyzing influent and effluent quality of vermifiltration at hydraulic loading of 4.8m(3)/m(2).d in a pilot scale. The results showed that the influence of the filter bed temperature on the removal of organics was in accordance with the binomial distribution and that on removal of NH4+-N was in accordance with the Sigmoidal equation. No obvious influence was detected on the removal of TN and TP. The experimental results also indicated that the optimal filter bed temperature of the quartz sand vermifiltration and the ceramisite grain vermifiltration were in the range of 15 similar to 24 degrees C and 18 similar to 25 degrees C, respectively. The ceramisite grain has a buffer capacity with the variations of the filter bed temperature, which has better resistance to the adverse impact of vermifiltration under lower and higher temperature conditions than that of the quartz sand. Additionally, the analysis of the insignificant influence of the different filter bed temperature on the removal of TN and TP was carried out. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this study, a method named carrier-mediated hollow-fiber liquid-phase microextraction (CM-HF-LPME) was proposed. The simultaneous trace analysis of aniline and catechol in real water were completed using the proposed method prior to gas chromatography. Experimental parameters such as extraction solvent, kinds of carrier, carrier concentration, extraction time and ionic strength of the sample were assessed and optimized. Finally, the enrichment factor (EF), limit of detection (LOD) and precision of the method for aniline and catechol were evaluated. The relative standard deviations (RSDs, n= 5) of 3.5% and 5.8% with good relative recovery of 99.3% and 102.8%, high EF of 32 and 25, LOD of 1.3 and 3.7 mu g/L were achieved respectively. The results demonstrated that the proposed method would be a competitive alternative sample preparation procedure for trace analysis. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Water deficit (WD) defined as the difference between evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation (PE) is usually used as sensitive index to measure the wetness and drought degree of climate and the water supplying condition of agriculture. In this paper, spatial pattern of actual ET in Songnen Plain of 2000-2009 growing season (denoted as gs) (from May to Sep.) was mapped using the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectra radiometer (MODIS) time-series products and meteorological data. Estimated ET was validated using eddy covariance system. It was found that the trend of the calculated and observed ET was highly consistent with the determination coefficient (R2) of up to 0.82. Then, WD was calculated based on estimated ET and observed PE, spatio-temporal patterns of WD were analyzed by using the GIS spatial methods. The results showed that multi-year average WD over the Songnen Plain differentiated from place to place with the value ranging from 26.91 to 692.51mm/gs and an average value of 228.74mm/gs. Regional average WD over the Songnen Plain varied significantly with the maximum value of 358.31mm/gs appearing in 2001 and the minimum value of 89.23mm/gs appearing in 2003. The sequence data of regional average WD displayed obvious decreasing trend with the negative slope of about -16.62mm/gs. At the monthly step, regional average WD varied a lot with the highest value appearing in May or Jun. and lowest monthly WD value appearing in Jul. or Aug. in most cases. Average WD values for different land covers in the total growing season were positive and exhibited decreasing trend in the order of water-body, wetland, woodland, cropland, built-up and grassland.

AB Tianjin Binhai New Area plays an important role to boost the economy of Tianjin and North China according to the long-term development planning of China. To ensure the sustainability of Binhai New Area in the process of industrialization eco-city construction will be a good choice. The study explores the current state of the sustainability of Binhai New Area by its comparison with Pudong New Area and Suzhou industrial park of China and some other foreign countries according to the three bottom line concept. We conclude that Binhai New Area has a better sustainable performance compared to the national standard. But compared to Pudong New Area and Suzhou industrial park and other countries by most of the indicators Tianjin New Area has a poor sustainable performance. Economic growth, resource consumption, water quality, air quality, waste treatment and disposal, public green space, cleaner production level of the companies and public traffic proportion are some challenges faced by Binhai New Area and we contend eco-city construction will be an effective way to improve the sustainability of Binhai New Area. Thus, we suggest that a good partnership among stakeholders such as government, companies, citizens and universities will help establish, manage and promote the development of eco-cities.

AB V2O5/FeVO4 photocatalysts were successfully epared prepared by one-step liquid phase precipitation. The photocatalytic activitied of the V2O5/FeVO4 series catalysts with different V2O5 contents were discussed. The as-prepared samples were character-ized by XRD, SEM and BET. Also the photocatalytic activity was measured by means of photodegradation of methyl orange(MO) in the solution irradiated by visible light. It was found that the 3mol% V2O5/FeVO4 and calcinated at 800 degrees C for 4h had the best ability of photo-degradation of MO, the degradation rate can increase18% or so than that of pure FeVO4 after 12h. Doping V2O5 can act as electron traps promoting the electron-hole separation and then in-crease the photo-activity. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Spatial data mining techniques used to retrieve high-dimensional spatial information from WSN is effectively. It is the extraction of implicit knowledge, spatial relations or other patterns not explicitly stored in spatial database. In this paper, we discuss the efficiency of nonlinear spatial data dimensionality reduction strategy based on local linear hypothesis for saving communication cost in wireless sensor network monitoring data gathering. Moreover, a nonlinear spatial data dimensionality reduction algorithm based on Local Mapping was proposed for rendering effective spatial data retrieval services in the resource constrained WSN. The algorithm can be associated with the present features in spatial data and project high-dimensional data to feature space by using local mapping linear embedding for reducing the computation of spatial data retrieval. As the experiment results shown, the algorithm can preserve important spatial feature information and provide effective preprocessing analysis results. Furthermore, the algorithm is the more effectual on feature preserving than local linear embedding (LLE) when the sample space is sparse source data. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The index system of water ecological carrying capacity (WECC) is constructed based on Pressure-State-Response model. In light with the calculation of water ecological carrying capacity in different years, the development tendency of WECC in Liaoning Province is analyzed. It concludes that WECC of Liaoning is lower than that of national average. It is thought that the shortage of water resources is the limitation of the water environment in Liaoning. Finally, some effective suggestions to improve the WRCC of Liaoning are proposed. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The improvement of methane yield from sodium acetate in the presence of Co2+ chelators, serine, lysine, and cysteine respectively, was investigated in this study. The results showed that the addition of chelating agents promoted methane fermentation of acetate. At a sodium acetate concentration of 7 g/L, temperature of 35 degrees C, and Co2+ concentration of 10 mu M, methane production was enhanced 50.1%, 45.6% and 14.7%, by the addition of 1 mu M serine, lysine, and cysteine, respectively. It showed that the best complexant was serine, and its addition of 2 mu M led to the maximum methane production of 295 ml. Accompanying with that, the coenzyme content was increased from 0.347 to 0.526 mu mol/gVSS for F420, from 78.2 to 93.5 mu mol/gVSS for CoM, respectively. The results found that the addition of serine could increase the solubility and availability of essential metal nutrients, and promote the growth of the methanogenic population.

AB The enhancement of methane production in an anaerobic continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) by adding nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) was investigated in this study. The reactor was operated for 41 days at the condition of a COD concentration of 4000 mg/L, a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 18 h under (35 +/- 1) degrees C. The results showed that the COD removal efficiency could be maintained at about 60% after 16 days of operation when the feed wastewater had no NTA. While, when 10 mu mol/L NTA was added to the feed wastewater, the methane production of the reactor was increased from 14.3 to 27.4L/d and the COD removal efficiency achieved 80%. Simultaneously, the acetate, propionate and butyrate concentration were decreased to 305, 217, 17mg/L, respectively. The experiment of specific methanogenic activity tests found that the addition of NTA could increase the bioavailability of trace metal elements and the methane yield was enhanced. It can be concluded that the operational strategy of addition NTA was a feasible way to enhance the methane production and it could be applied in industrial wastewater treatment.

DE Municipal solid waste; strength; deformation
AB Based on the development of Environmental Geotechnics, it discussed the properties, composition and classifications of municipal solid waste. Much attention is directed to the strength and deformation characteristics of solid waste. The municipal solid waste at a suburban Landfill in Beijing was investigated in laboratory tests including sieve analyses, triaxial compression tests to investigate the strength properties of municipal solid waste. The tests show that a larger distribution of strength parameters and the shear strength of solid waste is relatively high. The deformation characterization of solid waste is studied. The solid waste is with a small deformation compared with the general soil. The deformation of solid waste generated by loading is affected not only with the state, but also filling time. The deformation curve can be divided into two types: one is "concave" curve for the filling time short, the other one is "on the convex" curve for the filling time longer. The settlement of landfills needs to beconsidered in the design. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID QUALITY
AB The overflow reducing strategies of the drainage system in a chosen area is simulated by applying the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Considering the high cost of constructing new pipeline network and reservoirs, four easy and cheap measures for reducing the overflow of drainage system, such as the reconstruction of pipe network, the dredging of pipe network, the changing of land surface properties and the re-division of catchments, have been proposed in this paper. The following results are obtained for the case of one year return period. (1) By enlarging the diameter of " bottleneck" pipes and re-dividing the catchments, the performance of the pipe network is improved and the overflow volume of the whole drainage system is reduced by 13.74% and 11.45%, respectively. (2) By increasing permeable area 10% and 20%, the overflow volume of the whole drainage system is reduced by 30.30% and 55.26%, respectively. (3) When dredging 0.1m and 0.2m thickness of sedimentation in pipelines, the total overflow volume of the drainage system is reduced by 27% and 69%, respectively. Numerical results also indicate that the manning roughness coefficient of pipelines has great effects on the performance of the drainage system. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Multi-objective decision making is common in environmental management, but it is not yet further developed within GIS. A compromise solution to the multi-objective problems under conditions of conflicting objectives with GIS-based Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) method is investigated. GIS-based OWA is a relatively new Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) method, in which both criteria weights and order weights are considered. Calculation method of order weights based on Orness, and construction method of comparison matrix for criteria weights based on analytical hierarchy program (AHP), are introduced. Single objective multi-criteria evaluations with GIS-based OWA method for conflicting objectives are worked out. According to the data of influence factors in Tangshan City, criteria are established, images of influence factors are standardized, criteria weights and order weights are calculated. Single-objective suitability maps are obtained, and the multi-objective problem is solved. Finally, the calculating results are analyzed, and some advice is proposed.

AB In this study, the agriculture by-product grain sorghum stalk which modified by citic acid(CA) was used as a new adsorbent to remove cationic dye methylene blue(MB) from aqueous solution. The morphology characteristics and superficial charateristics of the adsorbent were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy XPS, respectively. The effects of the pH of the solution, contact time and initial dye concentration were concerned. The kinetics study showed that the adsorption processes followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, confirming that the sorption rate is controlled by chemical adsorption. The equilibrium process had been described by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm. Langmuir isotherm exhibited the most appropriate to predict the experimental results and the maximum adsorption capacities was 534.76 mg/ g for MB. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Global warming has been paid more and more attention because the global mean surface temperature has been increasing since the late 19th century. From the beginning of 20th century, urbanization has become an important contributor for global warming. Pearl River Delta (PRD) in southern China is one of the regions which are experiencing a rapid urbanization process that has resulted in remarkable Heat Island (HI) effect, which will be sure to affect the regional climate, environment, and society development. In this study, Landsat TM images for 1990 and 2008 in the PRD were selected to retrieve the surface temperatures and land use and land cover types. Object-based classification was proposed to extract 6 land use types from the satellite images. Additionally, surface temperatures were retrieved using the mono-window algorithm. It was found that correlations between land use and temperature are strong, the expansion of built-up area determined the distribution of Heat Island. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Land use and land cove are influenced mainly by human beings in the short history period. Built-up area expansion especially the urban sprawl has been inducing the land surface changed in the whole of the world since last century. Pearl River Delta Estuary in south of china has experienced the rapid economic boom since the implement of Open Door Policy in 1979. Four sets of Landsat image (TM/ETM+) acquired respectively in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2008 were used to obtain the land use types through the object-based classification method. The build area expanded dramatically with the flow of migration from all parts of China while the rural land degraded obviously. During 1990-2008, the built-up area increased from 605.50 km(2) in 1990 to 2394.25 km(2) in 2008, meanwhile the rural land, including farm land, fishery, forest and shrub, decreased. The built-up area in East Pearl River Estuary (Dongguan and Shenzhen) expanded 1337.12 km(2) from 1990 to 2008 while the expansion in West Pearl River Delta Estuary (Zhongshan and Panyu) was only 548.96 km(2). Influenced by the land use policy, the built-up area expansion in 1995-2000 was only 145.17 km(2) while the expansion in 2000-2008 was 891.07 km(2). (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Direct applications of remote sensing thermal infrared (TIR) data in landscape ecological research are rare due to limitations in the sensors, calibration, and difficulty in interpretation. Currently there are lot of methodologies for examining the relationship between land surface temperatures (LST) derived from TIR data and land use/land cover extracted from remote sensing images. In this study, Landsat TM images of Pearl River Dleta, Guangdong province, acquired in 1990 and 2008, were used to get the 6 land use types of built-up land, arable land, water, fishery, and shrub. Next, pixel-based LST was retrieved for 1990 and 2008 using the thermal band of Landsat TM image. An examination of the relationship between the land use/land cover (LULC) and LST maps was finally conducted to comprehension their interactions. Results indicated that Landsat image was effective for quantifying the heat environment and providing reliable measurements of land use change. LST was found to be positively correlated with impervious surface but negatively correlated with vegetated land. Each temperature zone was associated with a dominant LULC category.

The density of agricultural inputs, the density of pollutants in livestock and poultry are selected as a measure of pollutant discharge agricultural non-point source pollution emissions target. The per GDP are selected as an indicator of economic growth. The result shows that the density of inputs is a unilateral Granger cause of economic growth. However, there is no obvious Granger causality between the density of pollutants in livestock and poultry and economic growth. With the development of the economy, we must pay attention to controlling the amount of chemical fertilizer, understanding the input of pesticides the contribution to economic growth.

AB This paper investigates the systemization process of environmental impact assessment (EIA) in China through the review of China's experience in EIA implementation and legislation. The purpose of this study is to analyze the key driving forces of this systemization process and provide advice for future improvement of China's EIA system. It is found that there are three key drivers promoting the systemization of China's EIA: the Government's powerful guidance on the environmental policy implementation; the critical environmental pressure caused by the scale expansion of construction projects and planning activities; and people's consciousness-raising on environmental protection and environmental rights. Based upon the analysis results and China's political, legislative and administrative characteristics, some recommendations are proposed to improve the effectiveness of EIA system in China, in terms of internal measures on refining EIA legislative framework and external mechanisms concerning supporting the efficient operation of EIA legislation.

AB In order to investigating the effect of the green and blue algae and their different algal cell densities on the allelopathic activities of Potamogetion pectinatus, the allelopathic inhibitions of P. pectinatus on planktonic algae Scenedesmus obliquus and Microcystis aeruginosa were studied in this paper. By comparing the intensive changes of allelopathy at different initial concentrations of algae in laboratory exudation experiments, algal intensity threshold values under the allelopathy from this submerged plant were evaluated. It was found that allelopathic effects depended on the initial algal concentration and the algae species. The allelopathic effects of P. pectinatus on S. obliquus at different initial concentrations were not the same though all tests showed algal growth inhibition. The exudates of 2.5 g.L-1 P. pectinatus significantly inhibited the growth of S. obliquus at the all five initial algal cell concentrations after 3 or 6 days incubation. The growth inhibition rates of S. obliquus at the initial concentration of 10(6), 10(7) and 10(8) ind.L-1 were more higher than that of 10(4) and 10(5) ind.L-1 after 3 days incubation, and after 6 days incubation, the growth inhibition rates were all increased except the initial algal cell density of 10(8) ind.L-1. The allelopathic effects of P. pectinatus on M. aeruginosa were a little weaker than that on S. obliquus after 3 days incubation, and the inhibition rates increased after 6 days incubation. The exudates of 2.5 g.L-1 P. pectinatus exerted significant growth inhibition on M. aeruginosa at the initial concentrations of 10(7) and 10(8) ind.L-1, while weaker effects were observed when the algal initial concentrations were below this range. Comparing with the results of S. obliquus and M. aeruginosa, S. obliquus of a wide concentration range could be inhibited by P. pectinatus, while M. aeruginosa was not as sensitive as S. obliquus do.

AB In order to further enhance the degradation of the hydrogen peroxide related reactions, a series of reactions were investigated to compare their degradation efficiency. It was proved that hydrogen peroxide alone was not capable of decolorizing the dye significantly. Under 254 nm ultraviolet irradiation, the decolorization efficiency was dramatically increased compared with the oxidation by hydrogen peroxide alone. The dye was also subjected to the degradation by potassium permanganate and subsequent hydrogen peroxide oxidation due to the limited oxidation capacity of potassium permanganate. Acidic and alkaline conditions were proved to be favourable for the dye decolorization, while the lowest decolorization efficiency was always observed at pH 7.0. The combined oxidation by hydrogen peroxide with potassium permanganate and ultraviolet irradiation was proved to be especially effective and has the potential for practical water and wastewater treatment.

AB Due to the rapid advances in computer technology, numerical modeling and simulation shows powerful tools in the analysis for civil engineering, especially in the field of pile foundation. In order to numerical simulate the pile soil interaction to study the mechanical deformation characteristic of soil and pile, the numerical software FLAC3D is used to simulate the procedure of pile being loaded in the soil. In the simulation, the soil consists of two types, the less consolidated soil and normal consolidated soil. Piles interact with the grid via shear and normal coupling springs. The behavior of the shear coupling springs is identical to the shear behavior of a grouted cable. After calculation, the mechanical characteristic of pile, response of soil are analyzed, the corresponding skin friction stress and axial stress distribution of pile are obtained, both the negative skin friction stress and positive skin friction stress are studied as well as the vertical displacement of soil, whose result can give some guidance for the further study.

AB Incompleteness is a distinctive feature of current information data and incomplete information processing has become the study hotspot in Information processing fields. The main task of incomplete information processing is to forecast unknown information based on the available information data. There are many forecasting models used commonly at present and each forecasting model has its advantages and disadvantages. To achieve better prediction results, we proposed a new nonlinear combination forecasting model based on RVM and neural network. In this combination model, RVM model is adopted to classify the initial predictions and the results can be used in the learning process of neural network. The similar predictions are kept and the anomalous predictions are removed. In this way the learning speed of neural network can be improved greatly, and the disadvantages of predictions falling into local minimum can be overcome to some extent. In its organizational structure, we adopt nonlinear parallel organization form, that is to say the two forecasting models work synchronously, the prediction results of each model are passed to another model as control signal. The organization structure enhances the robustness of forecasting model and reduces the probability of abnormal results. Test results show that the proposed method has superior nonlinear forecasting ability, higher precision of prediction and broad application prospects. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Two groups of different gas flow rate experiments were conducted with a benchtop concentric cylinder dielectric barrier discharge reactor to investigate how the change of the gas flow rate affects the effectiveness of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) treatment flue gas pollutants. Results show that the gas flow rate has little influence on nitrogen oxides removal effectiveness when the input energy density is identical. Thus when dealing with relatively high gas flow rates, the residence time needn't be worried too much, if the equipment could deposit enough energy into the gas. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In order to estimate soil water content by ground-penetrating radar, an experimental was conducted at Fukang Station of Desert Ecology of Chinese Academy of Science located in the southern part of Gurbantunggut desert. Ground Penetrating Radar is used as the main data collection tool. Considering the higher accuracy of wide angle reflection refraction measurement and the faster speed of the fixed offset measurement of ground penetrating radar, a method is presented for the determination of optimal fixed offset based on the obtained average dielectric permittivity of the former. The result showed that: A decreasing trend for the average dielectric permittivity was found with increasing fixed offset of antennas Between 0.36-1.36m along survey line by fixed offset measurement. According to the minimum deviating principle of the average dielectric permittivity, 1.71 m was determined as the optimal fixed offset in the study, the ground wave of this fixed offset was picked and soil water content was calculated, and the average water content of 0.36-1.36 m along survey line is only higher 0.0016 m(3)/m(3) than that of wide angle reflection refraction measurements, the accuracy can meet the actual demand, the average water content of the upper sandy showed spatial heterogeneity between 0-36.5 m along survey line, This method can accurately fast estimate mesoscale soil water content which can provide a scientific basis for agricultural production and crop irrigation.

AB Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) is critical for sustainable development of the industrial park. As an indispensable part of the system of regional environmental impact assessment (REIA), air quality assessment and regional atmospheric environmental capacity are prerequisite for the planning and development of the industrial park. Based on selecting the factors of atmospheric quality assessment, the evaluation and prediction of regional atmospheric environment quality were conducted in Pingchang Industrial Park, Sichuan, SW China, using Single Factor Evaluation Method and Box-type Air Quality models in this paper. The results showed that regional environmental atmospheric quality in this park met the requirement of Standard Grade II of National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The atmospheric environmental capacity is 301.1 t/a, 1000 t/a for SO2 and TSP respectively, and meet the requirements of total mass control of pollutants and environmental capacity. Accordingly, the comprehensive countermeasures for prevention and control of the air pollution with characteristic of "source control + end treatment + trace monitoring" was proposed.

AB In recent years, Bohai Bay has suffered serious ecological degradations. In this paper, a numerical model was set up to simulate the dynamics of the plankton ecosystem of Bohai Bay and to estimate the potential effects of a sea reclamation project in this area. The model used herein is a coupled eco-hydrodynamic model which is composed of a hydrodynamic sub-model and an ecological sub-model and is capable of simulations of basic biogeochemical cyclings of dissolved nitrogen (DIN), dissolved phosphorus (DIP), phytoplankton (PPT) and zooplankton (ZPT) under advection, dispersion and ecological processes. The model has been calibrated and verified by using field data. The study predicted significant variations in the concentration distributions of phytoplankton and nutrients in areas surrounding the project after the reclamation. Increase in phytoplankton and nutrients levels in the northern and southern areas were observed which might indicate an increase in the risk of eutrophication and algae blooms. The results of the analysis provided important information for the project and eco-environmental management. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Anaerobic digestion; biogas; middle scale units; cow manure; optimum
   operating condition
AB Biogas production in anaerobic digestion in middle-scale units will be typically performed under mesophilic conditions in China when used for producing bioenergy and treating agricultural waste such as animal manure. A study has been made on biogas fermentation from cow manure in a 100 m(3) anaerobic digester equipped with a mechanical agitator under controlled temperature (35 +/- 2 degrees C)for this purpose. TS concentration should be controled more than 5%. The biogas generated from the anaerobic digester had the methane concentration as high as 60% (v/v) at TS concentration varied from 5% to 6% after the 10th day. During the start-up period, concentrations of TN, TP and COD decreased gradually, but concentrations of NH4-N and VFA increased. However concentrations of these composition varied narrowly at normal operating time. The pH was stabilized between 7.19 and 7.81 after the 8th day, which suggests that the anaerobic system of cow manure would adjust itself and stabilize pH. The biogas production rate exceeded 110 m(3)/d at optimum operating temperature(35 +/- 2 degrees C). Biogas with 60% CH4 or higher was produced under optimum operating condition.

AB Eco-sensitivity is the premise to protect and utilize the natural resources rationally. Eco-sensitivity analysis was carried out on Sa Er'hu scenic area in Liaoning province by GIS and RS technology. Six factors including slope, aspect, elevation, land use, distance to reservoir and landscape value were chosen. The area was divided into 5 parts: high sensitive, sensitive, relatively sensitive, low sensitive and non sensitive by superposition method. Evaluation results objectively reflect the regional ecological and environmental conditions. Countermeasures were put forward for the zoning of the protection of eco-environment, and to provide support for coot-donating the contradiction between tourism development and resources protection. The study is of significance for the eco-protection, utilization of resources and the sustainable development. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB With the development of the economy and the increase of the population, environmental problems draw more and more attention. The advection-diffusion equation describes the physical transportation of the passive pollutants in the environment, in which the treatment of the advection term is important and difficult. A three-dimensional numerical model based on cubic interpolated pseudo-particle (CIP) method is developed for the solution of the advection-diffusion equation. CIP method is used for the advection terms, which is assumed to be a good method to treat these terms to minimize the numerical diffusion. The comparison of numerical results for advection-diffusion equation based on CIP method with analytical solution for advection-diffusion problems from one-dimension to three-dimension has been performed, which shows the accuracy of the CIP method. A unique method to get the analytical solution for advection-diffusion process in unsteady non-uniform flow is also discussed. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Net primary productivity (NPP) estimation is an important study field of global change and terrestrial ecosystem. Here, we present an integrated modeling system for NPP estimation. It's brings together remote sensing, GIS and an ecosystem estimation model without requiring users to have any knowledge of any other specific software. The benefit of the system is that it provides complete spatial coverage and high temporal resolution, versus plot samples from which it may be difficult to provide an overall assessment for large-scale study. Recent advances in service-oriented architectures are allowing us to share of model results by geospatial services and create distributed applications needed for the collaborative research. Multi-layer approaches allow the system more flexible and easy to extend. A preliminary system was carried out for monitoring the dynamic changes of terrestrial ecosystem NPP in China. State-of-the art processing algorithms was developed based on an improved CASA ecosystem model. And then, the NPP time-series of Chinese terrestrial vegetation is built. The System is capable of querying, retrieving, and visualizing datasets with heterogeneous formats. The results show that the average NPP and total NPP for the study area in 2006 were 298.9 gC m(-2) yr(-1) and 2.839 Pg C respectively. The modeled results illustrate a high degree of spatial and temporal heterogeneity. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In order to alleviate pollution of urban sewage river sediment, planting experiment is conducted to study phytoremediation of Lolium Perenne to heavy metal pollution in the circumstance of adding hydrogen peroxide before planting. Results show that after adding hydrogen peroxide before planting Lolium Perenne in sediment the total concentration of lead and cadmium in sediment decline and the ion exchangeable phase of heavy metal increases a lot. The amount of ion exchangeable phase of lead in sediment after adding hydrogen peroxide before planting Lolium Perenne is 46.27 mg/kg which is larger than the one of only planting by 16.58 mg/kg. While the amount of lead of ion-exchangeable phase in original sediment is only 0.001mg/kg. The amounts of carbonate bound, Fe-Mn oxide bound and organic bound also show adding hydrogen peroxide before planting Lolium Perenne can promote accumulation and translocation of heavy metals to plants. Therefore adding hydrogen peroxide in phytoremediation experiment will become an efficient method to solve the problem of contamination of heavy metal in sewage river sediment.

AB In this paper, 16 economic, social and environmental indicators were used to evaluate the urban livability in Gansu. The principal component analysis revealed six principal components with eigenvalues more than 1, the most important of which represents economic development, and others represent environmental quality, geographical location, living standards, medical facilities, and urban traffic condition. The comprehensive scores of six principal components exhibited that the level of livability of the cities in Gansu is totally low, and the differences in livability between these cities are significant. The livability of cities in different regions are significant as well, with cities in Hexi corridor being more livable than those in eastern parts and northern cities being more livable than those in southern parts.

ID VEGETATION
AB As an index denoting vegetation cover, NDVI is influenced by many climatic factors such as precipitation and average temperature. In this paper, NDVI is calculated on the basis of waveband characteristic of NOAA/AVHRR data for the YarlungZangbo River Basin. Then, the spatial-temporal change of NDVI is analyzed. The basin's NDVI is in consistency with season from 2001 to 2003. Large value zone of NDVI is mainly distributed in the lower reaches and part of the middle reaches. Meanwhile, point-data of principal climatic factors are interpolated to spatial grid data with Kriging method consistent with NDVI based on DEM of the YarlungZangbo River Basin. Then, the relation of NDVI and precipitation or average air temperature is analyzed with F checking and two-sample variance test in the basin. The result is P=0, which shows that correlation analysis has larger confidence. The linear and logarithmic correlation of NDVI and precipitation or average air temperature is analyzed at confidence level of 0.05. The conclusion is that NDVI and precipitation and average air temperature in the basin vary with seasons and are closely correlated. The linear correlation coefficient of NDVI and precipitation is 0.8, and that of NDVI and average air temperature is about 0.77. And the logarithmic correlation coefficient of NDVI and precipitation is 0.71, and that of NDVI and average air temperature is 0.7. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The oil spill emergency plan is the base information for the emergency decision-making, and could act as an assistant for the decision maker in the oil spill emergency decision-making. However at present, the role of the oil spill emergency plan supporting the oil spill emergency decision is fulfilled by the decision maker through reading the prepared text plan, thus in an urgent situation, the effect of the oil spill emergency prepared plan for the emergency decision support is limited. In order to solve the problem, this paper studies oil spill contingency plans and oil spill emergency response decision-making in-depth, and Case-based Reasoning (CBR) theory is first used to design plans for oil spill emergency response decisions based on computer reasoning system, so as to provide quick solutions to improve the capabilities of emergency decision support for oil spill contingency plans.

AB At present, there are few components that can be reused directly to construct a new software system. In order to meet the requirement of the application environment, component need be modified before its reuse. For the different kinds of users, component modification can be occurred in the interface and the implementation. This paper presents a mechanism of component modification to the application environment. At first, the component description specification for modification is defined. Then for the interface modification and the implementation modification, the corresponding modification modes based on specification are proposed. Finally, modification method and related support process are presented. With the help of the proposed modification mechanism of component, the users can modify component regularly and effectively.

AB In arid area of western China, due to harsh natural conditions, ecosystems are less stable and easily affected by human activities. In recent decades, significant amount of research on the impact of human activity on environmental change in arid areas have been done. Though no particular conclusions were drawn, a number of eco-environmental data were accumulated. For lack of effective means of sharing, these data exit in form of "Information Island". To use the data more efficiently, a WebGIS prototype for regional eco-environment service system is constructed using open source software such as PostgreSQL, PostGIS, GeoServer, OpenLayers and etc. Implementation techniques, system function and key procedures were also described. This system, of high practical value, will be able to provide the public, scientists, and administration with convenient and rapid access to eco-environmental information.

AB River ecosystem health assessment is one of the hotspots in the current river ecology research. A health river must be a river with equilibrium of natural function and social function. The evaluation indexes system and criteria for river ecosystem health are established based on the scientific, practical and concise principles. In order to evaluate river ecosystem health scientifically, TOPSIS model is applied to evaluate river ecosystem health. In this model, AHP theory is applied to determine the evaluated index weight. Then the evaluation model is applied to Beiyun River health assessment. The result shows that it is in the "unhealthy" level which is coherent to the actual condition. It also validates the evaluation model is simple and feasible in river ecosystem health assessment. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The objective of this study was to investigate chemical contaminants penetrated into groundwater form the vadose zone. Infiltration experiment was performed in the field and an iodine-starch staining method was applied to visualize flow paths in the soils. The cluster analysis method was used to distinguish preferential flow regions. Base on the difference of water content before and after infiltration and the volume of the stained region, the recovered water content was calculated. Results showed that stained patterns played a much important role in redistribution of infiltration water than the soil saturation change in the stained region. The chemical contaminants concentration decreased dramatically in the upper depth and then the decreasing trend was slowed down. The chemical contaminants transport is more complex than water flow.

AB Activated sludge model (ASM) is applied into represent complex biochemical reaction between various contaminants in wastewater and microbial wastewater treatment system. Based on activated sludge ASM 1 model in this paper, the aerobic process COD is separated into dissolved easily biodegradable organics, soluble inert organics, particulate non-biodegradable organics, particulate slow-biodegradable organics and particulate inert matter produced by heterotrophic biological decay. With a volume constant and completely mixed batch reactor, the process of simplified ASM 1 model was described. The simplified model improves the speed because of the less parameter with a similar simulation result used by ASM 1 model. But it is very necessary to adjust the model parameter in different industrial wastewater treatment. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cold heavy oil production with sand (CHOPS) is a non-thermal method used in primary recovery. It improves heavy oil recovery rates by aggressively producing sand to form regions of increased permeability-wormholes and generating foamy oil flow. The oily solid waste is one of the main wastes in this oil field production process, which also stands as a critical negative factor that impedes the improvement of oilfield environment. The oil sand, which is rich in oil and black viscous compound in appearance, is the solid waste that comes along with the oilfield production. It mainly comprises of crude oil, slurry and a little water. The composition of the sludge mixture changes with the accumulation time in the field.
   The oil sand mixture has huge amounts in magnitude, and it contains a certain amount of BTEX, phenol compounds and other organisms that affect the human body and surrounding animals and plants. Hence it is necessary to operate appropriate disposal and achieve a lower negative effect to the environment. The disposal of the waste occupies a great portion of all CHOPS application costs. Therefore, the promotion for a more economic and effective treatment method has been another issue for improvement of the CHOPS technology.(a)
   The current prevailing method for waste treatments is non-toxicity handling and resource utilization, including the extraction separation technique, water-washing method, demulsification method, carbonization, incineration, and biological treatment. Based on the methods mentioned above, we present an overview and comparison in the strengths and shortcomings for each. An analysis for the factors that affect the industrialized treatment for oily solid mixtures is also provided. This paper ends with propound advices on application of these technologies.

AB By the reflux to different sites, that is all reflux to denitrification stage (DN) or shunting circuit into settling bucket and DN at a certain proportions, the performance of pre-denitrification biological aerated filter in a pilot-scale was assessed, especially enhancing denitrificaion methods for low carbon-to-nitrogen domestic sewage. The results showed that in the condition of all reflux to DN, at the reflux ratio ranges from 100,130 to 150%, the average removal efficiency of TCOD enhanced with the value 58.5, 62.3 and 65.8% and that of NH4-N was 84.5, 87.5 and 94.7%, whereas the average removal efficiency of TN presented 37.1, 40.9 and 39.7%. In the test, the removal increase of total nitrogen had no unanimous increase with the reflux ratio increase. The TN average removal achieved 56.4% and 60.5% when the quantities of reflux were shunted circuit to settling bucket and DN by 1: 1 and 2: 1 at 130% of the return flow. Therefore, most of reflux passing by settling bucket for oxygen consumption was the better proposal of improving TN removal efficiency for low C/N wastewater. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, a co-processor centric multilayer runtime library (CellLib) was proposed by extending memory access library and enhancing the co-processor's independency. The library supports both MPI and release-consistency-based Pthread programming model. The structure of multilayer runtime library and the flexibly extended memory access library not only make the model more efficient and scalable but also enhance the performance of irregular applications. In the model, while MPI programming interface enables large exiting MPI applications to be ported to the CBEA easily and facilitates the traditional parallel programming, the release-consistency-based Pthread programming interface offers an efficient task runtime library to both MPI and the system-level users who need full control over the architecture. The experimental results show that the proposed multilayer runtime library is suitable for various applications and can achieve better performance by using a profile based on optimizing technology built in memory access library.

AB Accurate prediction of stock market is very important to obtain high profits from stock market. As the operational parameters of support vector regression are usually determined by user, which leads to bad prediction results. In the paper, genetic algorithm and support vector regression (GA-SVR) model is developed to predict stock market, and genetic algorithm selects the best parameters of support vector regression. The comparison of the prediction error between GA-SVR and BP neural network to show the excellence of GA-SVR compared with BP neural network in the experimental analysis. It can be seen from the comparison results of the prediction error between GA-SVR and BP neural network that GA-SVR can gain the lower prediction error than BP neural network in the stock market prediction.

AB In this paper, we propose a recognition model of multi-emotion states from electroencephalogram (EEG) based on Bayesian Networks. The subjects' emotion states (anger, happiness, and neutral) are elicited by using emotional videos along with collecting EEG signals from fourteen channels around the scalp. We use Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) to select input features of this model from power spectrum values of fifty six frequency bands of fourteen-channel EEG signals with each being divided into four bands. Experimental results show that the proposed model performs well and using EEG to detect multi-emotion states is feasible. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Computational models of driving behavior developed based on a cognitive architecture can provide better scientific understanding of driving, simulate driving behavior, quantitatively predict possible interference of in-vehicle tasks, and thus help develop human factors guidelines and tools for in-vehicle systems design. Driver lane changing is a common activity in driving. Therefore, modeling driver lane changing with a cognitive architecture should be an important component of cognitive models of driving behavior. In this paper, we develop a computational model of driver lane changing control with the Queuing Network-Model Human Processor (QN-MHP) cognitive architecture based on neuroscience and psychological findings. The simulation and experimental results from lane changing on straight and curved roads suggest that this model can perform the control process of lane changing well and the model's control process is consistent with that of drivers.

AB An efficient adaptive reservation multiple access protocol with traffic-predicting and retransmission scheduling (ARMA-TR) is presented for wireless multimedia networks. In the protocol, access slots are divided into voice and video mini-slots (VMs) only for active voice and video terminal (VTs) to transmit their reservation requests, and sharing mini-slots (SMs) shared by VTs and data terminals for resource reservation. Based on traffic-predicting approach, the amounts of VMs, SMs and information slots can be adaptively adjusted to efficiently match current voice and data traffic load. Retransmission-scheduling mechanism endows constant bit rate (CBR) traffic more priority than variable bit rate (VBR) traffic and gives VTs with CBR traffic from silent phase to talkspurt phase more chance to access channel resource than the terminals with VBR traffic and newly-generated CBR traffic. Simulation results show that the proposed protocol can efficiently and dynamically allocate the available bandwidth to communication sessions according to the requirements of quality-of-service (QoS) and current traffic load.

AB Dimension reduction is a critical issue in the analysis of high dimensional datasets, because the high dimensionality of data set hurts generalization performance of classifiers. It consists of two types of methods, i.e. feature selection and feature extraction. Here we present a hybrid feature selection mechanism (HFS) which combines both filter and wrapper models for dimension reduction. In the first stage, we use the filter model to rank the features by the Relief algorithm between each feature and each class, and then choose the highest relevant features to the classes with the help of the threshold. In the second stage, we use Shepley value to evaluate the contribution of features to the classification task in the ranked feature subset. Experimental results show obviously that the HFS method can obtains better classification performance than solo Shepley value based or solo Relief algorithm based method.

AB Semi-supervised learning require new feature selection methods to work on unlabeled examples. Informed researches deal it with "filter" feature selection methods which may not work well for classification tasks. Genetic algorithm is one of widely used supervised feature selection methods. In this paper, we introduce a "wrapper-type" genetic algorithm based semi-feature selection method. In essence, it uses unlabeled examples to extend the initial labeled training set with the help of classifiers. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets show that our proposed method, generally, outperforms both traditional supervised and state of-the-art "filter-type" semi-supervised feature selection algorithms by 1% to 7% in accuracy.

AB This study aimed to explore the effects of coniferous forest and broadleaf forest on soil labile organic carbon in the Badaling mountainous area of Beijing. The results showed that in the different types of vegetation, total soil organic carbon (SOC), light fraction organic carbon (LFOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) varied by decreasing trend with increasing soil depth. The contents of LFOC and DOC in coniferous forest were significantly lower than those of broadleaf forest at soil depth of 0-10cm and 10-20cm. The ratio of LFOC content to the total SOC content ranged from 14.08% to 4.63%, while ratio of DOC content to the total SOC content ranged from 1.26% to 3.15%. The ratio of LFOC content to the total SOC content decreased with increasing soil depth, whereas the other ratios changed by opposite trend. A significant relationship was found between the LFOC and DOC; both of LFOC and DOC were significantly correlated with total SOC. Broadleaf forest is helpful to accumulate SOC.

It enables chemical-free operation to reduce the pollution of the environment. A new supersonic separator with a supersonic delta wing is designed for gas/liquid separation. The natural gas flow field in supersonic gas/liquid separators is numerical calculated with the RNG k- epsilon turbulence model. The numerical results show that water and heavy hydrocarbons can be condensed and separated from natural gas under the combined effects of the low temperature (-86 degrees C) and strong centrifugal field (600000 g. g is the acceleration of gravity).

AB To deal with the problems of information integration and data sharing among directed heterogeneous application systems in gear enterprises, a functional architecture of information integrated platform is proposed after detailedly analyzing the information integrated operation mode of gear enterprise networked manufacturing. The application integrated framework of gear enterprise is constructed with the technology of Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) and Web services, and the software architecture of application integrated framework is implemented in the. NET environment. Finally, example of actual hypoid gear networked manufacturing is introduced to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed platform. The successful experiment also proves that the proposed platform can commendably meet the needs of information integration and data sharing for gear enterprise. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Secure mobile agent; strong non-designated proxy signature; multi-proxy
   agent
AB It is expected that mobile agent will be widely used for electronic commerce as an important key technology. If a mobile agent can sign a message in a remote server on behalf of a customer without exposing his/her private key, it can be used not only to search for special products or services, but also to make a contract with a remote server. To construct mobile agents, we used an RSA-based undetectable signature scheme, but it does not provide server's non-repudiation because the undetectable signature does not contain server's signature. Mobile agent is a very good application example of proxy signature, and the undetectable signature can be considered as an example of proxy signature. In this paper we show that secure mobile agent can be constructed using strong non-designated proxy signature which represents both the original signer's (customer) and the proxy signer's (remote server) signatures.

AB Effect of single and combined pollution of oxytetracycline (OTC) and Pb on enzyme activity was researched by using incubation experiments. The results showed catalase activity was inhibited in single and binary system at all incubation time except 100 mg (OTC+Pb)/kg treated soil at seventy-fifth day. Catalase activity of binary system was not significantly different from single pollution from fiftieth to seventy-fifth day. Urease activity was inhibited in single system (except Pb polluted soil at the first day) and binary system ((50 mg OTC + 100 mg Pb)/kg treated soil) from 1d to 15d, but the changes of urease activity was complicated at the later stage. It is difficult to assess the pollution level by enzyme activity. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We demonstrate how the model can be fitted to the writing of a particular individual using repeated samples of their printing. We also investigate how well the model separates one person from another. At last, we pick out that a differential equation is a useful means of modeling this time-varying behavior. The paper gives some suggestion of computer's simulating persons' handwriting. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Algae can cause much nuisance in lakes and reservoires due to bloomtorming and production of toxins and off-flavours. There are air sacs in the body of Microcystis aeruginosa to float Microcystis aeruginosa up to the upper layer water in order to obtain plenteous light for its growth and reproduction. The amount of Microcystis aeruginosa in the depth of 3 times water transparency is more than that in upside and under-side. The floating up velocity of Microcystis aeruginosa was measured under still water, the floating up velocity of 77% Microcystis aeruginosa is not more than 1cm/min, and there are 10% Microcystis aeruginosa whose floating up velocity is between 1 similar to 1.5cm/min, 6% between 1.5 similar to 2cm/min, and 7% more than 2cm/min. When the water flow gone downwards with the velocity of 1.65cm/min, Microcystis aeruginosa's floating up will be prevented. An air mixing system has been applied in a water source of Tianjin Jieyuan water plant to control the algae growth. It was found that the content of phytoplankton chlorophyll-a was reduced by 13.96% (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE wireless sensor network; localization; mobile beacon; path planning
AB Location information is critical essential and indispensable for many applications of wireless sensor networks. Beacon-based localization schemes are more precise than beacon-free ones, but the beacon nodes are more expensive than ordinary sensor nodes. Recently, there has been much focus on mobile-beacon based localization, for they can lower the cost while keeping the localization precision. This paper surveys the current state of the art for mobile-beacon based localization algorithms. We give the taxonomy of these schemes including range-base vs. range-free, single beacon vs. multi-beacons, omni-directional vs. directional antenna. Moreover, we also give a review of path planning methods which are critical to localization algorithm with mobile beacon, and we classify them into static and real-time schemes. We briefly introduce the steps of each localization and path planning algorithm, which serves as an introduction and survey for researchers interested in the area of localization of wireless sensor networks.

DE asteroid; equilibrium point; orbital resonance; stable region
AB In order to study the satellite's moving features and the size of stable reigns around the center equilibrium points of asteroid, 1:1 resonant orbits theory are applied in this paper. First the Hamilton function described by Delaunay variable is simplified to Schubart standard. Secondly the simplified mathematical model is used to discuss the form of orbital motion, vibration period of satellites which locate orbit the asteroid's equilibrium points and the relationship between each other. And then Asteroid Vesta is taken as a simulation example to verify the correctness of these conclusions above. Finally, exploiting the properties of energy integral of Schubart standard, the formula of deducing the radius of stable region around the center points is given, which is also applied to analyze the properties of orbital motions both inside and outside of the stable region. The research in this article not only can help us better understand the equilibrium points of asteroids and the dynamical environments in the vicinity of which but also can it supply theoretical basis in designing the orbit around the equilibrium points around the asteroid.

AB Ship traffic lights is a constantly changing light and dark circular spot. To quickly and error-free receive the signal light in an complex environment the recognition system needs to identify intensity and shape of the light signal. Hough transform is a description for the boundary and shape of area and commonly be used to extract curve from a complex background. But its two disadvantages, massive storage requirement and high cost of computation, limited its application in real-time recognition system. This paper presents an integrated optimization algorithm which is focus on reducing the sampling points, reducing dimensions and utilize parallel computing methods. The system can recognize circular signal in real-time from a series of continuous images(size: 800x600 pixels) and make close to 100% accuracy. At the same time as the characteristics of parallel computing, the computing power of the system is easy to expand. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Water hyacinth is becoming an environmental problem in lakes, ponds and waterways in many parts of the world. In this study, its application as raw material for furfural production was investigated. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to study the proper process parameters to determine the optimal furfural yield from water hyacinth. Experiments were carried out as per Box-Behnken surface statistical design with four input parameters namely temperature (T : 160-220 degrees C), sulphric acid concentration (C-H2SO4: 0.1-0.9 mol/L), liquid/solid ratio (L/S : 20-80, w/w), hydrolysis time (t : 30-130 min). Regression analysis showed good fit of the experimental data to the second-order polynomial model with coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.9102 and Fisher F-value of 8.69. Optimization of T (185.5 degrees C), c(H2SO4) (0.9 mol/L), L/S (62, w/w), t (77 min) gave a maximum of 2.94 % furfural yield. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, the photoinhibition of four naphthoquinone compounds including Atovaquone, Buparvaquone, Menadione and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone were determined. And the preliminary study on the influencing factors and the mechanism of photoinhibition was performed based on some molecular descriptors calculated by the quantum chemistry calculation. The results showed that the inhibitions of Hill activity by four 1,4-naphthoquinone compounds presented the same trends and dose-effect relationships. Among them, Buparvaquone had the highest inhibitory activity. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis indicated that E-LUMO might be one of main factors affecting the inhibition of Hill activity by the chemicals having the similar structures with these compounds we tested. At the same time, the lipid/water partition coefficient (logP) and the diameter (Dia) of molecule were also the influencing factors. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It is observed that starch grains and chloroplast were destroyed dramatically. Vacuole increased both in volume and in numbers, and protoplasm shrinked in the experimental groups treated with high CdCl2. Distorted membrane and indistinct cell wall were found at the same time. The experimental groups exposed to CdCl2 for 24 h showed that the mitochondria was hardly affected. Results showed that effect of CdCl2 on ICE-L was depended on treated dose and time.

The existence of biorthogonal finitely supported vector-valued wavelets associated with a pair of biorthogonal finitely supported vector-valued scaling functions is discussed. Construction of wavelet bases is an important aspect of wavelet analysis, and there are many kinds of scalar scaling functions and scalar wavelet functions. A new procedure for designing a class of biorthogonal vector-valued finitely supported wavelet functions is proposed by virtue of multiresolution analysis approach and filter bank theory. A novel method constructing two-directional biorthogonal wavelet wraps. The notion of biorthogonal two-directional finitely supported bivariate wavelet wraps with three-scale is introduced. Their properties is investigated by means of time-frequency analysis method, matrix theory, convergence theorem and operator theory. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Water crisis has become the critical point in limiting cities' economical and social development nowadays. With the sharply increasing conflict of supply and demand of water resources, the prediction of ecological water demand is becoming an important part in urban water resource management. Thus, based on the overview of theories and methods for the calculation of urban ecological water demand, this paper introduces a multi-objective system dynamic model which combines system dynamic model with multi-ecosystem theory to simulate urban ecological water demand, with Dalian City, China as a case study. It is demonstrated that the proposed model can be an applicable and flexible method and it also provides an alternative approach for sustainable urban water utilization which can reconcile the conflict between urbanization process and water resource restraints.

AB This paper studies the vehicle rollover warning based on the vehicle running state parameters which are easy for collecting. By taking advantages of neural network and support vector machine, this paper analyzes the probabilities of the vehicle rollover in the scenario of single lane change and establishes a warning model which could predict the rollover 0.4 seconds in advance for a particular type of vehicle. According to the validation experiments on VeDYNA which is a vehicle dynamic simulation software, the results validate the warning model's good performance with the maximum error as 0.04 second and no missing cases which indicates its validity for rollover warning.

AB Small Unmanned aerial vehicles commonly use PWM signals for servo control. In order to verify the flight controller design, it is necessary to measure the PWM control signals. There are two difficulties: real-time and high precision. The PWM signal must be measured per 20ms punctually and the pulse width must be accurate to 0.001ms. In this paper, a new pulse width measuring method based on VxWorks and PCI8554 timer card is introduced, including the structure of measurement system, measurement algorithm and VxWorks driver developing techniques of PCI device. By testing, this measurement system's real-time and accuracy performance satisfied UAV test facilities' requirements. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID METROLOGY
AB Precision spatial 3D localization is important for complex geometry and large-scale assembly in industrial environments. Current solutions for these problems are either unreliable or too expensive. In this paper, we present an optical location system based on rotating planar laser beams. In this system, sensor acquires location by measuring bearing respect to two or more transmitters. The key feature of the system is the ability to simultaneously measure multiple targets. Initially, we introduced the components of system. Following introduction, we discuss the metrology process models and the bearing measurement principal. At last, we build a prototype platform including three transmitters and one sensor to verify the method. The results of the experiments show that the repeatability accuracy of angle measurement is better than 2 arc second and the coordinate deviations is less than 0.5mm in 5mx5mx3m area. According to the principal of the system, the location accuracy will not increase with space, if the number of transmitters is enough. Therefore, this system can achieve relative high precision, and can satisfy the need of large-scale assembly. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID RISK-ASSESSMENT
AB The biodegradation processes are closely related to the hydro-geochemical activities. To realize the transport and fate of petroleum contaminants in subsurface, an insight into the identification of the biodegradation is of notable significance. In this work, several typical sensitive redox components as hydro-geochemical markers include DO, Eh, NO3-, NO2-, dissolved Mn and Fe, SO42-, S-2(-), HCO3- and pH were investigated to identify the biodegradation pathways in groundwater. The analysis demonstrated that the major biotic activity was sulfate reduction in groundwater during monitoring period. Sulfate serving as the major electron acceptors was critical for oxidizing hydrocarbons, which also leaded to interactions with other hydro-geochemical markers. Then a statistical model was built to verify above conclusions that the hydro-geochemical environment was mainly controlled by the regional background and sulfate reduction process tied in closely with TPH, while the biodegradation products were interconnected with dissolved Mn and Fe, HCO3- and pH.

AB The results of environmental risk accidents have important relations with the spatial distribution of population. In this paper, by combining the habitations extracted from the ALOS remote sensing images in 2008 with the statistical population data of Dalian, the author simulated the population density based on GIS modeling. The average relative error between GIS-based simulation results of population and statistical data is 9.78%, the accuracy is high, and simulation results could reflect the actual spatial distribution of population. The population distribution and HOTSPOT are analyzed, which are followed by calculating the number of residents under environmental hazard within fire-protection distance and sanitary protection zone of Songmudao Chemical Industry Park (SCIP) and Dagushan Harbor Industrial Park (DHIP). Specific research conclusions are as followed: Firstly, the distribution of Dalian population density has showed an apparent spatial autocorrelation with the test value of Moran's I being 0.86. Secondly, there is a strong heterogeneous trend of population density and seven HOTSPOTS are founded including Dalian metropolis, Jinzhou urban area, Maqiaozi of Dalian Development Area, urban zone in Lushun, the urban area of Wafangdian, Pulandian and Zhuanghe City. Thirdly, there are 7603 and 1332 residents within the state specified fire-protection distance of 150 m, while 15637 and 13552 residents correspondingly within the state specified sanitary protection distance of 1 km buffering of SCIP and DHIP. Finally, there really exists a great difference between the number of residents under environmental hazard calculated by statistical population data and population density results which are stimulated by GIS modeling, the average relative error of the results is up to 81.4%.

AB In the course of mining frequent neighboring class set, present algorithms have some redundant candidate and repetitive computing, which are only able to efficiently extract short frequent neighboring class set, and so this paper proposes an algorithm of fast duplex mining frequent neighboring class set, which is suitable for mining any frequent neighboring class set. This algorithm adopts two methods to generate candidate frequent neighboring class set in the mining course. One is using top-down search strategy to generate candidate by numerical index, the other is using anti-code of front this candidate to generate next candidate frequent neighboring class set. The course of top-down search strategy used by the algorithm isn't different from traditional top-down search strategy, which uses numerical index to generates k-subset of (k+1)-non frequent neighboring class set. By the two methods, the algorithm may delete redundant candidate and repetitive computing. The algorithm creates digital database of neighboring class set via neighboring class weight, according to character of database, it also uses digit logical operation to computes support. The result of experiment indicates that the algorithm is faster and more efficient than present algorithms when mining frequent neighboring class set in large spatial data.

AB Ecosystem respiration (ER) and soil respiration (SR) are responding to soil moisture and temperature in different ways due to biological and physical processes operating within an ecosystem. We examined daily and seasonal ecosystem respiration and soil respiration of a poplar plantation located in the temperate climate in northern China by using the eddy covariance and soil respiration chamber methodologies respectively during the entire growing seasons in 2007 and 2009. We analyzed the different responses of ecosystem respiration and soil respiration to soil temperature and soil moisture. The soil respiration of the growing seasons was 519.29 and 495.69 gCm(-2)y(-1) in 2007 and 2009, comparing to ecosystem respiration of the growing season was 701.42 and 594.70 gCm(-2)y(-1) in the two years. On an average, the sum of soil respiration and ecosystem respiration in the growing season in the wetter year was larger than that in the drier year. Soil temperature was the main drive factor of soil respiration during 2 years. Ecosystem respiration was more affected by soil temperature in the wetter year comparing to that it was more controlled by soil moisture in the drier year. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Agro-forestry ecosystems; light intensity field; shelterbelt; shading
AB This paper based on the measured of light intensity and wheat production within the shelterbelt, with surfer graphics software, correlation analysis and regression analysis of classical statistical methods to analyze relation between wheat yield and light intensity within agro-forestry system. The results showed that the order of average light intensity was: south >west >east >north of the shelterbelt. Wheat yields can be divided into four regions: greater than 810g/m2 for the high yield areas; between 740.51 and 809.35g/m2 for the level-producing areas; 600-740.51g/m2 were cut areas; less than 600 g/m2 were serious cut areas. Judged by wheat yield divided regions above, wheat yield reduction was not serious, but relatively large distributed of area on the east side of shelterbelt; seriously cut areas mainly distribute in the north of shelterbelt; east and south of shelterbelt almost did not have serious cut areas; The size of correlation between light intensity and yield per unit area was north of shelterbelt (0.850) > south of shelterbelt (0.564) > west of shelterbelt (0.554) > east of shelterbelt (0.474). The relationship between light and yield in north of shelterbelt was consistent with Compound model, the south of shelterbelt is consistent with Exponential model; the scale of shading was: north of shelterbelt was about 0-0.7H, south of shelterbelt was about 0-0.3H, east of shelterbelt was about 0-0.3H, west of shelterbelt was about 0-0.5H.

AB To evaluate ecological environment of river system in suburbs of Beijing efficiently, Pressure-State-Response model theory was explained, comprehensive assessment index system and fuzzy probability assessment model were built. The proposed methodologies have been used to assess ecological environment of famous Andamu river folk-custom tourism area of Beijing, China. Modeling results concluded that the naturalness level of ecological environment within the study area can be divided into 4 grades: (I) Natural degree; (II) Near-natural degree; (III) Degraded degree; (IV) Artificial degree. The total ecological environment state of Andamu river belonged to degraded degree, which signified restoration measures were needed urgently. Decision Support System (DSS) of river ecological environment assessment was also built by programming Visual Basic language to help visualize the distribution of different ecological environment naturalness grades of studied river system. The assessing results fit the field survey well and can be used for restoration and future management of river system. Restoration measures for different ecological environment levels were also recommended. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Li-ion battery is a most attractive energy source for portable electronic products. With its consumption enhancing, there will be a large amount of spent Li-ion batteries in the following years. Unless the spent batteries would be disposed appropriately, they might cause serious environmental problems especially soil and groundwater contamination because they contain a lot of valuable metal resources. Recovery of spent batteries is becoming a pressing issue. This paper aims at introducing and comparing several methods to recover metals and materials from spent Li-ion batteries. The conventional recycling methods are sometimes sophisticated, and the development of an economical and simple synthetic route for recycling is quite worthy of consideration.

AB When bioradar detects the survivals under the ruins, it is hard to find the ideal signal as reference in signal-processing. A variable step-size LMS adaptive spectral-line enhancement algorithm based on error rate is introduced and applied to the signal-processing of bioradar by studying a number of conventional adaptive algorithms. This algorithm doesn't need an ideal signal as reference with good convergence, small steady-state error and good robustness. MATLAB simulation has proved that it is effective in signal-processing of bioradar. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Returning Farmland to Forest Project; Regional Ecological Risk
   Assessment; Landscape Indexes; Eco-Environmental Resilience; Mudanjiang
AB Long-term deforestation and over-harvesting directly led to serious soil erosion and sharp forest deterioration, and the Eco-Environment in Mudanjiang became worse and worse. So the government there took the Returning Farmland to Forest Project (RFFP) firstly in Heilongjiang Province in China in 1999. On the basis of deeply understanding the Eco-Environmental problem of soil erosion and the Ecological Risk Definition, this paper put forward an Ecological Risk Assessment Model with Landscape Indexes and Eco-Environment Resilience. This model firstly calculated the landscape indexes of every sample by fragstats and then obtained the spatial distribution of Ecological Risk by ordinary Kruger interpolation. The results showed that: the landscape fragmentation improved after the RFFP, the Eco-Environment Resilience increased significantly because the forest area increased obviously and the serious soil erosion was controlled by the high vegetation cover, which in the end made the Ecological Risk drop down rapidly, from 0.003-0.952 to 0.003-0.310. The area proportion of minor, slight and moderate risk increased separately from 7.65%. 13.71% and 21.39% to 18.85%. 33.04% and 33.24%, while the intense and server declined respectively from 31.46% and 25.79% to 14.88% and 0%. In a word, the model possessed advantages of intuition and simplicity and could descript the regional ecological risk quantitatively and its spatial distribution intuitively.

AB For the Image threshold segmentation, local contrast information is not sufficient used for threshold, the border is a single pixel wide, but is deviation from the true boundary point. Gradient segmentation does not take full advantage of global information, which can get the real boundary points, and affected by noise with not complete single-pixel contour. By analyzing the threshold segmentation and gradient segmentation, fused with which a segmentation algorithm is proposed. The histogram threshold is studied in three ways: interactive, iterative and the Otsu method, and the wide valley impact on image segmentation is analyzed, the algorithm of selecting the best threshold is designed. The optimal threshold is researched on the gradient mean of the same gray value, which integrates the local gradient and global threshold. Experimental results show that the algorithm not only considers the adjacent consistency of the image information, but also taking into account the local contrast, and improve the effect of simple threshold, which is an effective and practical image segmentation algorithm.

AB The absorption behavior of modified alumina loaded with dimethylglyoxime for nickel is studied. The conditions of adsorption and elution of nickel is established by experiment. A new method of pre-concentration, separation and analysis by Atomic Absorbance Spectrophotometry (AAS) for nickel on modified alumina loaded with dimethylglyoxime is proposed. The results show that modified alumina loaded with dimethylglyoxime for nickel has better adsorptive power at pH 9, and the capacity of adsorption is 25 mg/g. The elution efficiency is 100% when nickel is eluted by 5 mL 2mol/L hydrochloric acid. The modified alumina loaded with dimethylglyoxime can be used three times repeatedly. The proposed method has been applied to determine nickel in groundwater samples with satisfactory results. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ecotoxicity of residual solvents of pharmaceuticals on daphnia magna was studied by acute test. The results showed the order of toxicity of residual solvents of terramycin, thiamine hydrochloride and thiamine mononitrate was benzene > carbon tetrachloride > 1, 2-dichloroethane > 1, 1-dichloroethylene > 1, 1, 1-trichloroethane, dichloromethane > tetrahydrofuran > toluene > methanol> ethyl acetate = acetic acid = ethanol, N-methylpyrrolidon > N, N-dimethylacetamide > methanol > aether, respectively. The ecotoxicity of methanol in combined system was more severe than that of in single system. The LC50s of methanol were 72.21, 91.94 and 3.357x10(4) mg/L in thiamine hydrochloride, thiamine mononitrate and in single system, respectively. It was likely that the toxic effect of residual solvents increased in the presence of potential competitors. The study provided baseline information which was necessary to assess the potential hazard of some residual solvents released into water ecosystems. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Eco-sensitivity analysis is the premise and basis for the planning of regional ecological environment, while the protection and improvement of the ecological environment is the key to the regionally sustainable development. With the GIS technology and by using the factor-overlap method, the eco-sensitivity of the New Riverside Center of Nanjing City is thoroughly analyzed in this paper by selecting 4 categories of regionally representative factors. Then this paper classifies the study area into absolutely sensitive ecological sub-areas, high sensitive ecological sub-areas, generally sensitive ecological sub-areas and low sensitive ecological sub-areas according to the level of eco-sensitivity. It further proposes measures and suggestions to regional protection and construction, so as to provide reference for the development of local urban and rural construction and environmental protection. The results show that absolutely sensitive sub-areas and high sensitive sub-areas account for about 42.8% in the total area, indicating that the eco-sensitivity of the study area is generally high.

In real-world, there are many problems mentioned in complicated systems, traditional MIML structure would only consider the initial and final state, when facing with more tanglesome system, the lack of middle decision layer will affect the whole capability of system. The new proposed structure - layered MIML frame will help us to solve these tasks more easily by middle layer with reward mechanism. Finally, we use RoboCup Simulation 2D as platform to verify our frame and algorithms, the result shows the frame presented is valid and well-performed. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Meteorological measurements combined with sap flow techniques provided a low-cost option to study the rates of water uptake by individual trees response to environmental factors on a continuous basis. Modeled canopy conductance (g(c)) has often been used to predict transpiration (E-c) with the Penman-Monteith (P-M) model. However, a Jarvis-type model modified to direct estimate the Ec specifically rather than canopy conductance suggested an alternative method. For comparative purpose we parameterized both P-M and modified Jarvis-type model using a series of environmental control functions: vapor pressure deficit, solar radiation and air temperature. Both approaches provided good predictions of canopy transpiration and explained 85% and 89% of the variance respectively. These two modeling methods offer a reasonable estimation of water use in the determination of water balance for land water resources planning, vegetation management and impact assessments of rehabilitation.

AB 15 urban wetlands in Nanjing City were collected to be studied for their vegetation and water quality monthly from March 2008 to February 2009. Further more, the variation of the water quality among 15 urban wetlands was revealed at two scales, i.e, urban wetland ecosystem scale and the catchment scale. Results showed that, (1) the wetland styles including protosomatic wetlands (PWs), secondary wetlands (SWs) and reconstructive wetlands (RWs), together with plant coverage density impacted the water quality obviously at the ecosystem scale. Water qualities in PWs were better than those in SWs and RWs, and the more plant coverage, the better the water quality was. (2) Land use types and impervious areas were the important factors influenced on the water quality at the catchment scale. Resident land and other construct land made the water quality bad at the catchment scale. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   oxide
AB The antibacterial property of silver has long been known and used in various applications due to its high toxicity to bacteria and low toxicity to humans. Excessive algae growth has been a common problem for landscape water in many urban areas in China. In this study, silver oxide in the form of tetrasilver tetroxide coated on pebbles was used to investigate its effect on inhibiting algae growth. Experiment results showed that a rapid and long-lasting algae-inhibiting effect was produced by the tetrasilver tetroxide-coated pebbles, provided that the water depth was less than a certain value. The first-three-days algae removal rates all reached above 50%, and the 90-day algae removal rates stabilized above 90% for experiments with water depths of 0.4 and 0.7 m. No algae-inhibiting effect was found when the water depth was increased to 1 m. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The affecting factors of CO concentration in propellant combustion gas have been researched and tested by the methods of theoretical calculation and experimental determination. Minimum free energy method was applied in theoretical calculation and the static test of closed bomb-gas chromatography was used in the later method. When the oxygen balance changed from -23.074% to +9.226%, the CO concentration reduced 41.5284%. The experimental results show that the CO concentration in combustion gas can reduce by improving the oxygen balance of propellant and there is a similar linear relationship between the CO concentration and the oxygen balance of propellant.

AB The aim of this paper is to evaluate nitrate removal performance using various proportion of maifan stone (MFS) and activated carbon (AC) as bioflim carrier under different C/N ratios. Four columns filled with mixed maifan stone and activated carbon in different proportion (1/0, 2/1, 1/1, 1/2) were used as denitrification reactors in an up-flow mode. NO3--N, NO2--N, NH3-N, and pH were tested at hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 16h. The indication show that nitrate removal efficiency reaches above 99.5% for all the columns at the C/N ratio of 1 and 2(methanol as carbon source). When the C/N ratio is kept at 0.9 and 0.8, the nitrate removal efficiency of column1 is about 90%, a little lower than other three columns, however, the nitrite accumulation and ammonia production for column 1 is the least of the four columns. The results proved that no extra phosphorous and trace elements are needed due to the leaching performance of MFS. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Based on the 24-hour monitoring results of quality and quantity of wastewater discharged from the expressway service area, a three-step feeding A/O biological contact oxidation process was employed to treat the expressway service area wastewater which was of high-strength COD and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN). By two stages continuous experiment, the treatment effect of the process to the high-strength COD and TKN wastewater was studied. The experiment results indicated, when the three-step feeding A/O biological contact oxidation process employed to treat the high-strength COD and TKN wastewater, alkalinity was a decisive factor for the treatment effect of the process. When COD, TKN, ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations of the influent were 1030mg/L, 212mg/L, 153mg/L and 213mg/L respectively, and HRT was 36 hours, the removal efficiencies of the process to COD, TKN, ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen were higher than 95%, 98%, 98% and 80% respectively. The effluent quality was superior to the first discharge standard of integrated wastewater discharge standard (GB8978-1996). (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB E-government system can contribute to the work efficiency of public service and deal the governmental transactions conveniently by decision makers. However, numerous systems haven't integrated GIS functionality and information, which can extend the value of application systems by increasing accuracy, visuality, and productivity. In addition, the systems are difficult to rapid response against the changes of business requirements, and the program is hard to develop. This paper discusses the building and configuration technology, plugin technology for integration development by taking advantage of the enabling technologies of SOA and GIS.

AB A survey on the dangerous bridge along the mountain road in south-west China revealed that various degrees of damages had occurred to the stone arch bridges that had been in service for over 10 years. As these damages would affect their safety, it became the focus and the difficult part of the current research to evaluate the safety performance indicators of those stone arch bridges. With the application of multi-hierarchical fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, the relative weight of factors in each hierarchy was determined considering various factors affecting the bridges' bearing capacity; then the ratio of the structural resistance value to the external load of the bridges in active service was obtained; and finally the bridges' safety performance evaluation indicators were determined. The advantage of this evaluating system in actual project lay in its clear distinction between the important factors and the lesser ones, simplification of evaluation work and good evaluating effect.

AB The experimental amount for solving flutter derivative of bridge by free vibration method brought up by R.H. Scanlan is very large, and in process of extracting cross derivative it is difficult to achieve that frequency ratio and damping ratio of vertical motion and torsional motion of model is the same in all wind speed. Besides, the identification error of uncoupled derivative will be in coupled derivative. The paper presents an improved method based on Ibrahim time domain. Extracting all flutter derivatives of bridge deck with optimizing algorithm of DFP is better in solving the nonlinear parameter identification than the least squares method.

AB Object-oriented Framework (OOF) enable reuse at both code level and design level by capturing the commonalities of an application domain into a set of carefully designed abstract classes with well-defined collaborations. It is very difficult to use OOF because the sizes of the framework are often large and many of the existing frameworks suffer from the lack of proper manuals and documentation. In this paper, the concept of Maximum Sharing sub-Edge Tree (MSET) is proposed. Based on the MSET, we propose an algorithm for mining the framework hot-spot instantiation pattern.

AB The identification problem on the dynamic parameters in LuGre model is studied. The identification method proposed uses a neural network which considers weights boundary. The network structures and weight adjustment algorithm are given out. In order to find a set of parameters to make it approach the actual one, this algorithm uses neural network identification within the bounds of the identified parameters. Compared with the non-linear least squares (NLS) parameter identification, the relative errors of parameters which are identified by neural network based on weights boundary (WBNN) are smaller, and the precision is higher. Numerical simulation is provided to show the efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Ontology; Semantic web; Information Retriveal
AB The purpose of the Information Retrieval (IR) is to find a set of documents that are relevant for a specific information need of a user. Traditional Information Retrieval model commonly used in commercial search engine is based on keyword indexing system and Boolean logic queries. One big drawback of traditional information retrieval is that they typically retrieve information without an explicitly defined domain of interest to the users so that a lot of no relevance information returns to users, which burden the user to pick up useful answer from these no relevance results. In order to tackle this issue, many semantic web information retrieval models have been proposed recently. The main advantage of Semantic Web is to enhance search mechanisms with the use of Ontology's mechanisms. In this paper, we present our approach to personalize web search engine based on ontology. In addition, key techniques are also discussed in our paper. Compared to previous research, our works concentrate on the semantic similarity and the whole process including query submission and information annotation. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly, the region of interest was determined by search of wavelet magnitude maxima in the preprocessing step of images, and the affine transform was chosen as the image transform model. Secondly, the probability distribution of grey value was estimated by interpolation of pixel values to calculate image intensity histogram. Finally, the simulated annealing algorithm was used to approximate the global optimum. The experiment data show that the algorithm was effective and feasible. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE face recognition; local gabor phase characteristic; characteristic
   fusion; locality dispersing projection
AB Traditional methods get low recognition accuracy in the condition of only one training sample. A new face recognition method based on local Gabor phase characteristic and locality dispersing projection (LGP/LDP) is proposed. In our proposed method, according to the good spatial position and orientation of Gabor filter, a Gabor filter with four frequencies and six orientations is firstly applied to filter face images. Based on Daugman's method and the local Exclusive- or (XOR) pattern, local Gabor patterns are then extracted to form the characteristic images. Finally, LDP is used to project the characteristic images of each spatial position and orientation into low dimensional space. Neighbor classifier is adopted and the classified information is fused to get the recognition result. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms other recognition method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), LDP and local Gabor phase characteristic integrated with PCA (LGP/PCA).

AB To investigate the fouling phenomena of ultrafiltration membrane caused by humic acid solution, four important parameters such as time, pressure, pH value and calcium ion concentration were considered in the experiment. The changes of various membrane fouling resistances and humic acid retention rates were also analyzed. Moreover, the surface and cross section of the clean and fouled ultrafiltration membranes was observed by emission scanning electron microscope. The results show that a rapid fouling takes place due to internal pore adsorption, pore blocking and a fouling gel developed on the membranes. Concentration polarization plays a main role in initial period. The pH value as the important parameter decided what kind of fouling playing the main role. As pH value ranges between 6 and 9, the membrane fouling is relatively light. Both acid and alkali can aggravate humic acid fouling: acid promotes the formation of the gel layer, while alkali accelerates the blockage of membrane hole. The existence of calcium ion will aggravate the fouling of ultrafiltration membrane and reduce the rejection rate of humic acid. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Because of the joints flexibility and the distortion of long tubular booms, high precision tracking and positioning performance of large space manipulator can hardly be achieved. As a result, during space capture process, big position error and escaping velocity between the end effector and the target object would exist even when the manipulator is pre-located. To solve this problem, a typical kind of flexible interface fit for space capture application is introduced to improve the capture ability of the end effector. Moreover, a visual based equivalent capture strategy is put forward to avoid the complicate modeling problem of the unknown correcting force that acts on the grapple of the target during capture process. The proposed strategy makes the complicate capture problem to be a simple position tracking problem. Meanwhile, a sliding mode controller based on the fuzzy switching gain is designed to suppress the disturbance by unknown extern force. Experiments show that the proposed strategy can improve the autonomous capture ability of the large end effector. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB To enhance the concurrency of the traditional sequential/program control systems, which adopt naive linear sequential ways of control step transition, the Domino sequential control system supports the simultaneous triggering of multiple control sequences and steps. Moreover, as the solution for the control flow continuation when a step failure is encountered, a two-way conditional transition mechanism is implemented through performing control steps bypathing. With the cooperation of the script engine embedded and a GUI configurator, Domino empowers users to customize control sequences to service all sorts of complicated control requirements proposed in the engineering of industrial automation systems. Moreover, to meet with the security demand enforced by mission critical applications, a two-layer precondition validation procedure is dedicated for the recognizing and prevention of user operation faults.

AB Nitrate pollution in groundwater is a serious hazard to people's health. Permeable reactive barriers (PRB) have become the core technology used to remediate nitrate pollution in groundwater. Seven different materials of normal compressive strength, viz. Shandong Longkou lignite, Inner Mongolia Pingzhuang lignite, Heilongjiang Sanjitun lignite, Yunnan Zhaotong lignite, anthracite, coke, and walnut shells were selected for denitrification-PRB media testing. Experimental results indicate that walnut shells had the highest nitrate removal efficiency, 80%, and their effluent concentration of NO3-N was under 3mg.L-1. Shandong Longkou lignite, Inner Mongolia Pingzhuang lignite, and Heilongjiang Sanjitun lignite also had the capability to release organic carbon-source slowly, and were able to be utilized effectively by the denitrifying bacteria. They could be used as the denitrification-PRB media. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Chaos immune optimization algorithm on distribution service restoration after faults is presented to improve the probability for optimal solution in this paper, which is integrated the characteristic of chaotic optimization with artificial immunity algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, excellent global search ability of chaotic optimization is regarded as "thick search" to initialize the antibody of immune algorithm, and local search of artificial immune algorithm is applied to replace "thin search" in the chaotic optimization, which assures the population diversity and avoids getting to stuck in local minima to a certain degree. A living example for a certain district distribution in Chongqing is analyzed by the method presented in this paper. The result shows that chaos immune optimization algorithm in the paper might improve convergence speed and precision of restoration and avoid premature convergence.

AB This paper predicts the temperature of optical transmitter and receiver through the BP algorithm based on MATLAB simulation platform. The inner temperature is affected by ambient temperature, heating power, air pressure, wrapping mode, whose stabilization needs corresponding adjustment of these conditions. And the BP network structure with 4-8-5-1 is adopted, the Tansig function is applied in the implication layer, at the same time, the Purelin function is applied in the output layer. At last, the finite samples are trained and tested through the MATLAB. Contrast with the PID algorithm, the simulation result shows that there is a higher precision and faster convergence in the BP algorithm. In the meantime, the generalization ability of the BP network gives inner temperature when there are 4 inputs, which reflects the basic feature of the whole system.

AB In recent years, most distributed multimedia applications are deployed directly on the Internet, and to carry real-time streaming services on the Internet is still very serious challenges. Internet is constructed on the basis of TCP/IP protocol, which provides the only best effort service, and adopts the best strategy of meet competition for all the service requests. This method lacks efficient resource scheduling classification, which leads to a variety of network resource sharing prone to bottlenecks and reduce the network throughput. Therefore, a good way to guarantee quality of service on multimedia application should be established based on the existing Internet architecture. In this paper, firstly, the low load balancing QoS routing technology is proposed with the application requirements of distributed multimedia services in overlay network. Characterization of the path through the establishment on the profit and loss model of resource consumption, resource consumption will be bound into the path of incremental choices. Secondly, the fast QoS re-routing technology is studied, and the introduction of reconstruction costs model, as constrained alternative routing process. Theoretical analysis shows that the method can effectively improve the efficiency of route recovery time and reduce the recovery delay. Finally, a dynamic QoS-aware approach to changes in demand is established. The training samples by the principle of self-learning assessment model to establish a unified system of shielding parameters of the difference between the ability to adapt to different QoS parameters for monitoring.

AB Mining closed frequent itemsets from data streams is of interest recently. However, it is not easy for users to determine a proper minimum support threshold. Hence, it is more reasonable to ask users to set a bound on the result size. Therefore, a real-time single-pass algorithm, called Top-k-FCI and a new way of updating the minimum support were proposed for mining top-K closed itemsets from data streams efficiently. A novel algorithm, called can( T), is developed for mining the essential candidate of closed itemsets generated so far. Experimental results show that the proposed Top-k-FCI algorithm is an efficient method for mining top-K frequent itemsets from data streams. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Assessment of heavy metal risk and spatial distribution for special area are fundamental to the study of soil environmental quality. The paper provides a case of artificial neural network using for the soil quality assessment, which does focus on eight heavy metal pollutants, Hg, Cd, Pb, Cr, As, Zn, Cu and Ni. Firstly, the paper introduces the Back Propagation Neural Network theory using in the soil evaluation of heavy metals pollutants. Secondly, the authors designed the model with 8 input parameters. Thirdly, the model was simulated and experiments were done extensively using MATLAB neural network toolbox. In the study area City Baotou and its suburbs, we totally collected 220 soil samples from measuring points. From the GIS analysis, we find that the pollution is mainly caused by human industrial activities. And the enrichment of heavy metals in topsoil is very obvious in industrial areas and regions near both sides of the Kundulun River. It is concluded that the model of BP neural network is a practical and simple method for the soil quality assessment. The model can take advantages of simple network structure, fast convergence rate and well generality for soil heavy metal pollution evaluation. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Heavy Metal Pollution; Multi-agent System; Geographic Information System
AB Soil is the basic natural resources, and its quality is closely related to the area topographical spatial morphology and various kinds of pollutants migration. It is heavy metal pollution that affects the normal function of the soil, resulting in the pollution of the food chain, and being great threat to humans and ecological environments. So it is important to establish the visual software platform for soil quality evaluation, in which the researchers can carry out the soil heavy metal pollution spatial analysis and qualitative assessment. It is reasonable that the software system was established using Geographic Information System (GIS) and Multi-agent System (MAS).
   The author focused on the method and key technology of the application of GIS and MAS technology used in the evaluation of soil heavy metal pollution. And in this paper, functions of every agent and cooperative relationships among agents in the system were deeply concerned. The system not only provides an integrated software platform to evaluate the heavy metal pollution and analyze the ecological disaster but also has the ability to soil quality forecast warning. To point out that the establishment of MAS-based safety warning of soil heavy metal pollution are extremely needed to the soil environmental development. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Soil indexes; Auto-correlation distance; Shear wave velocity
AB The stability of foundation depends on spatial average property of soil in some area, so the spatial variability of soil parameters need be considered in the processing of probability analysis. Soil spatial variability is related to soil point variability with the reduction factor of variance in random field theory, while the reduction factor of variance depends on both soil auto-correlation distance and spatial area. So auto-correlation distance is the key to the study on spatial characteristic. A systematic study is carried out on the peculiarities of auto-correlation distance of soil parameters in construction field. According to the datum of static cone penetration test curve, different ways to obtain auto-correlation distance are compared by large calculation. The sampling space effect on auto-correlation distance is studied. The feasibility of calculation horizontal auto-correlation distance by using of shear wave velocity is discussed. The peculiarities of auto-correlation distance of soil parameters are obtained by comparing of auto-correlation distance of different soil parameters and by comparing between vertical and horizontal auto-correlation distance of the same soil parameters. It has been shown that the auto-correlation distance of soil parameters has the peculiarity of transversely cross-isotropy. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB To enhance biological nitrogen removal in a subsurface wastewater infiltration system (SWIS), a novel bio-substrate was developed composed of 25% (mass mixture ratio) activated sludge, and 75% other components (meadow brown soil, grass carbon, cinder, and zeolite). SWIS was filled with meadow brown soil and constructed subsurface wastewater infiltration system (CSWIS) was filled with the bio-substrate. Microbial activities of the bio-substrate, ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) and total nitrogen (TN) removal effects were studied in both SWIS and CSWIS. The pilot-scale experiments showed that, at a hydraulic loading rate of 4 cm day(-1), CSWIS converted 88.1% of NH4+-N to nitrate nitrogen (NOx-N) and biodegraded 81.4% of TN, 10.1 and 10.7% higher than SWIS, respectively. On average, influent and effluent concentrations of NH4+-N during the whole experiment period were 25.0 and 2.2 mg L-1, respectively, 40.0 and 4.6 mg L-1 for TN in CSWIS.

AB The purpose of this paper is to provide a basis for construction of water conservation type of vegetation. In this paper, the forest soil pore distribution and water storage properties of four typical forests (mixed wood, broadleaf forest, bamboo forest and shrub forest) in Jinyun Mountain were compared. The water holding capacity of soil non-capillary of shrub forest is 88.24 millimeter, 83.52 millimeter in mixed wood, 75.96 millimeter in broadleaf forest, and 63.48 millimeter in the bamboo forest. The saturation water capacity of shrub forest is 361.62 millimeter, 323.16 millimeter in mixed wood, 295.62 millimeter in broadleaf forest, and 267.92 millimeter in the bamboo forest. The results indicated that the water holding capacity of soil non-capillary from high to low is shrub forest > mixed wood > broadleaf forest > bamboo forest. The shrub forest and mixed wood have higher water conservation function than the bamboo forest. Therefore, it is proposed that in the future the shrub forest and mixed wood should be afforested and managed firstly. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In order to improve the utilization rate of solar energy, the automatic solar tracking device driven directly by stepping motor emerges as the times require. However, with the relatively small torque and high cost, the stepping motor only can drive a limited number of panels. To solve this problem, an improved automatic solar tracking system is proposed, in this system double-rocker mechanism driven by stepping motor is used effectively to control a large number of photovoltaic arrays in horizontal and pitch direction. The experimental results show that, the system we proposed not only can automatically track the position of the sun Real-time and accurately, but also reduce the cost effectively, the generation efficiency is increased by 35% compared with the fixed photovoltaic arrays.

AB Accurately predicting terrestrial carbon (C) storage requires understanding the stock and storage potential of C, because it helps us understand how ecosystems would respond to natural and anthropogenic disturbances under different management strategies. We investigated organic C storage in aboveground biomass, litter, roots, and soil organic matter (SOM) in six land-use types (i.e. artificial pasture, AP; natural meadow, NM; corn plantation, CP; bare land, BL; pasturable grassland, PG; and enclosed grassland, EG) in meadow steppe of Northeast China. The primary objective of this study was to ascertain the impact of different land-use types on the stock and storage potential of C. The results revealed that the total C storage (including aboveground biomass, litter, roots, and SOM, i.e. 0-100cm soil layer) was significantly different between one and another type among the five pairs (P < 0.05), and varied from 5829.4gC m(-2) to 16451.6gC m(-2). The C stored in the aboveground biomass was less than 2014.2gC m(-2), accounting for negligible amounts (< 1% of the total) of total C storage except corn plantation in the ecosystem. The amount of C stored in SOM accounted for over 90% of the total C storage in AP, NM, BL, PG, and EG, and the C stored in litter was very low (< 1%), compared to other pools in the ecosystem. The amount of C stored in the roots varied from 0gC m(-2) for plot BL and CP to 450.6gC m(-2) for plot AP2, and it accounted for less than 5% of C storage in the grassland.

AB Heavy metals are common pollutants in contamination-involved emergencies. During recent years, heavy-metal-contaminated emergencies tend to occur more frequently with high intensity. The sulphide precipitation integrated membrane reactor is used to treat heavy-metal-contaminated water with Na2S acting as precipitant for heavy metals. Through pilot test, the qualities of effluent satisfy the class III water quality of "quality standard for ground water" (GB14848-93). Thus the sulphide precipitation integrated membrane reactor is proved as an effective method for removing the heavy metal in groundwater with high efficiency. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Lake surface temperature; Mono-window algorithm; MODTRAN; HJ-IRS
AB Remote sensing data has an important application value and scientific significance. in retrieval of lake surface temperature (LST). On September 6, 2008, China successfully launched two optical small satellites (respectively called HJ-1A, HJ-1B.) to monitor and predicate environment and disaster. HJ-1B satellite includes an infrared camera (IRS). The camera has a thermal infrared band which can dynamically monitor LST of large river basins in 4 days. HJ-IRS is a new sensor, so there are few papers researching on the retrieval of LST. The main goal of this paper is to introduce a practical method to obtain LST from HJ-IRS thermal data. In this paper, we reviewed primary algorithms of LST retrieval and mainly analyzed Qin's mono-window algorithm retrieving LST from Landsat TM6 (Thematic Mapper) thermal data. This algorithm included two empirical relationships about atmospheric transmittance and atmospheric average temperature. But these relationships are only suitable for TM6. So on the basis of the spectral response function of HJ-IRS thermal band we use radiance transfer software MODTRAN4 to simulate and calculate new coefficients in the two relationships. New algorithm requires three parameters: emissivity, vertical water vapor column and atmospheric temperature about 2 meters above the ground. We use two images of Lake Taihu to retrieve LST and validate the improved algorithm. Bias of LST retrieved from HJ-IRS data and the field measurements are smaller than 1.2K, which means this algorithm is applicable for HJ-IRS thermal band to retrieve LST.

AB Network reliability prediction is significant to make up the strategy for network management. In order to solve the local optimum of BP neural network, support vector machine(SVM) is proposed to predict network reliability in the paper. In the study, Grid method is applied to select optimal parameters of support vector machine. Thus, network reliability prediction model by SVM has four input nodes and one output node. The experimental network reliability data are applied to study the superiority of support vector machine. The comparison of network reliability prediction error between support vector machine and BP neural network demonstrates that network reliability prediction ability of support vector machine is better than that of BP neural network.

AB Microorganisms with high oil degrading performance are essential for bioremediation of soil contaminated with crude oil. A positive end dilution method was employed for the selection of crude oil-degrading functional consortium from contaminated soil. The selected consortium was consisted of Rhizobiales sp., Pseudomonas sp., Brucella sp., Bacillus sp., Rhodococcus sp., Microbacterium sp. and Roseomonas sp. and removed nearly 52.1% of crude oil at initial concentration of 10,000 mg/L at 30 degrees C within 7 days, with removal of aliphatic hydrocarbons by 71.4% and aromatic hydrocarbons by 36.0%, respectively. The effectiveness of the consortium for bioaugmentation was confirmed with microcosm test by contaminated soil (1.0 kg) from Karemary Oilfield, China. The removal efficiency of crude oil was enhanced to > 50% in microcosms with the consortium compared with 8-13% or lower in controls over a 60 day period. The crude oil removal reaction was probably first order reaction and the rate was greatly enhanced by bioaugmentation. Supplementation of nitrogen and phosphate sources had limited effect on the oil removal in the tested soil. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A multicomponent single-phase model was set for high-temperature heading face in this study, based on the mass conservation law, the momentum conservation law and the energy conservation law. The standard wall function was used to correlate the physical quantities near the wall and in the turbulence kern zone. Parellel calculation method was used to simulate the distribution of the temperature field and the flow field. The calculation results show that, the temperature of the airflow goes up nonlinearly along the channel from the heading and the distribution of the temperature field depends on the characteristic of the flow field. Then the temperature curves of heading face with air injection, whose temperatures are different, were analyzed. The section which is 7m far from the heading is the inflection point for all of the curves. The temperature gradient along the vertical direction increases quickly, but the largest temperature difference is less than 3K. So the comfort of human is satisfied under each temperature of the injection air. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Soils under five forest types (Lindera kwangtungensis x Cunninghamia lanceolata mixed forest(GS), Pinus massonianaxLindera kwangtungensis x Symplocos setchuanensis mixed forest(MGS), Phyllostachys pubescens x Pinus massoniana x Symplocos setchuanensis mixed forest(MMS), Gordonia acuminate x Adinandra bockiana mixed forest(SS) and Phyllostachys pubescens forest(M)) were collected in Jinyun Mountain of Chongqing City for the determination of SOC and total N content. Then the characteristics of SOC and C: N ratio of these forest types were analyzed respectively. The results showed that: SOC content and density decreased with the increase of soil depth and different among five forest types. The SOC density of five forest types was: GS (24.53 +/- 0.059 kg/m(2))>MGS (21.01 +/- 0.024 kg/m(2))>MMS (12.07 +/- 0.020 kg/m(2))>M (10.22 +/- 0.036 kg/m(2))>SS (7.72 +/- 0.015 kg/m(2)). The SOC storage of five forest plots were mainly in. and. horizon and the percentages of SOC storage in these horizons were 64.52% (GS), 81.59% (MGS), 93.36% (MMS), 94.92% (SS) and 86.03% (M) respectively.

AB As colleges and universities in recent years, the scale of the rapid expansion and the continuing reform of the educational system to improve university teaching management and assessment of classroom teaching workload of teachers in colleges increases every year, its complexity is also rising. The computer teaching reform as the high education reform pioneer has obtained some preliminary results. But how to improve the quality of college teaching has become a common concern to workers in high education issue. Carry out the classroom assessment work is conductive to school leadership and teaching management comprehensively and accurately grasp the teaching of information, strengthen education management, improve work efficiency, saving manpower, material and financial resources to improve teaching management science and decision-making. In this paper, focus on the specific computer teaching university management, data mining technology is introduced into the field of university teaching evaluation. We improve and optimize digital feature extraction model, and by teaching evaluation data mining, on the impact of teaching quality assessment scores of students, teaching a plus, ability to control factors such as class analysis, to find scores of teachers teaching the mapping between the various properties, and uses the data to test and eventually developed based on B / S structure of secondary school teachers in computer teaching evaluation system. It provides a supportive policy decision for education departments, this is helpful to develop teaching management and improve the quality of teaching in a better way.

AB On the basis of reviewing and summarizing the experience of MFA in china and abroad, the research framework of regional MFA are proposed, meanwhile the method was applied in city level, and analyzing the material flows in Tianjin city from 1998 to 2007. The results indicated that the total material consumption of Tianjin was 97.25 million tons in 2007. The amount of imported materials accounted for 46 percent of direct material input, and 40 percent of it was coal; it indicated that Tianjin largely depended on external resource. Moreover, the environmental capacity of Tianjin was at the saturated state, with water seriously polluted. The material productivity was being improved, but the efficiency of resources utilization was in a lower level. Finally, accordingly measures and suggestions were proposed to resolve the existing problems. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The fouling behavior of Bovine serum albumin (BSA) on Poly(acrylic acid)-graft-polypropylene membrane was studied by flux and streaming potential mearurement. A pair of electrode was used to measure the streaming potential of PP and grafted membranes. The zeta potential of grafted membranes calculated by streaming potential was negative in most pH range. The results show that the grafted membranes are markedly pH-dependence on both water permeability and antifouling behavior. All membranes show the most serious fouling behavior at pH 4.7(the isoelectric point IEP of BSA) and the smallest flux decline at pH 3. Compared with the ungrafted PP membrane, grafted membranes show more serious fouling behavior at pH 3, whereas 18% grafted membrane has a certain antifouling behavior at pH 4.7 and 8. The streaming potential of membranes changes with the BSA fouling on membrane. Therefore the streaming potential of membrane could be a adjutant means to evaluate fouling behaviour.

AB The unstable mode of the rigid pile structure is mainly the pressure instability of soil at the pile side in the anchoring section. According to the extreme values of the pile's side pressure at the two depth places below the anti-slide pile surface, the structure functions are respectively established to analyze the reliability of anchoring depth for rigid anti-slide piles under the two extreme values, and then with the consideration of the randomness and fuzziness in the reliability analysis for the anti-slide pile structure, the fuzzy random reliability analysis model is established. Taking the calculation of a rigid anti-slide pile for example, the fuzzy reliability index and fuzzy reliability of the structure are obtained, and the calculated results are consistent with the classical theory limit state factors.

AB It Load from overloaded vehicles far exceeds the design load, which severely threaten the safe operation of highway bridges and is one of the main causes of bridge collapse in recent years. This paper analyzes in detail the variation of the reliability index of flexural members of in-service bridges with the correction coefficient of vehicle live load effect and calculates respectively the reliability index of flexural members corresponding to different live load effect correction coefficient, adopting the statistic parameter of resistance and load effect suggested by Unified Design Standards for the structure reliability of highway engineering. Calculations show that overloaded transportation has significant effect on the safety of bridge members and bridge structure. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we proposed a contextual and Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) classification approach through the experiment, which was using Cognition Network Language (CNL) of commercial software eCognition Developer. Combination of spectrum and texture explored the rich information contents in the Very High-spatial Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. Meanwhile, contextual relation was adopted in the experiment to improve the classification accuracy. In the research, a few land cover characteristics (contrast, entropy, etc.) were studied for the local land covers. By the experiment, six different classes were extracted: building, road, forest, water, farmland and bare soil. 94.05% classification overall accuracy and 0.92 Kappa coefficient were achieved by the approach for the complex land covers. Data set was five bands QuickBird imagery located nearby Kunming Dianchi Lake (KDL), which is a very important highland lake in China, also in the world. The results may be used in lake protection, environment protection, land planning and land use management, and government decision making around KDL. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID DIFFERENTIAL-DIFFERENCE AMPLIFIER; BLOCK
AB This paper presents a flexible CAB (configurable analog blocks) topology for field programmable analog arrays (FPAA). A fully differential difference amplifier (DDA) was used as the core circuit block in the CAB. The CAB is mainly composed of DDA, several programmable capacitor arrays (PCAs), and programmable resistor arrays (PRAs). The DDA_based circuits often provide high input impedance and simple external circuitry, and therefore are competitive to the opamp-based circuits. The proposed DDA_based CAB has been designed in a 0.35 mu m CMOS+EEPROM process. Simulation results show that the presented CAB is powerful enough to implement the fundamental and certain complex analog functions, for instance, integrator, filters, subtracter etc. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Vehicular hydraulic brake system inherits switching dynamics from the actuator. Accordingly, a switched control approach, composed of three local nonlinear state feedback controllers, is presented to converge the wheel slip to the target point. The stability is analyzed using Lyapunov theory. Both analysis and simulation show that the controller is also highly robust to the actuator control. With a simple structure and few parameters, the approach is applicable in practice. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS
AB Target tracking is one of the most important applications for wireless sensor networks. Generally, multi-sensors working collaboratively can achieve better performance but with high-energy consumption in target tracking. In this paper, a dynamically clustering algorithm, called nearest neighborhood collaboration, is proposed for collaborative target tracking in wireless sensor networks. It selects cluster head based on minimum distance between predicted target position and sensor nodes. Cluster head forms the cluster of tasking sensors in its neighborhood and fulfills estimation update, next state prediction, and executes information fusion based on central Kalman Filter. Simulation results show that, compared with existing sensor scheduling algorithm, the proposed multisensor scheduling scheme not only achieve superior tracking accuracy but also energy saving, it is also robust to the uncertainty of process noise.

DE Phased array radar; Scheduling algorithm; Performance evaluation;
   Priority
AB A performance evaluation technique of adaptive scheduling algorithm is presented for multi-function phased array radars. First, the basic model of radar task is built, and the test environment for performance evaluation is described, which includes a set of scenarios with different target sets. The environment proposed is used for evaluating the performance of scheduling algorithm with different task request scales. Then, three quantified performance metric indices are presented, which are successful scheduling ratio (SSR), time utilizing ratio (TUR) and expected time shifting ratio (ETSR). The SSR, TUR and ETSR quantify the task scheduling capability, the usage of time resource and scheduled task time control of adaptive scheduling algorithm, respectively. Meanwhile, a new synthetic adaptive scheduling algorithm is proposed based on task function priority and task deadline.

AB An adaptive real-time divisible load scheduling algorithm including parameter estimation of network and allocation of divisible load is presented for unknown network system. Firstly, the scheduling model for real-time divisible load is built, which can satisfy the restriction of task deadline with the minimal network resources. And then the method that estimates network parameter values using a small fraction of the total load is given. Furthermore, optimal processor sequence and processor number is analyzed based on divisible load theory. Lastly the adaptive load allocation method is proposed for real-time tasks with bus network architecture. The validity of the proposed algorithm is proved by both theoretical analysis and simulation results. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Princeton Ocean Model (POM) is adopted to simulate the circulation and seasonal variation of average salinity in the northern South China Sea (SCS), and the influence of the Kuroshio Current and river diluted water on the distribution of salinity is also discussed. According to the simulation results, the salinity field changed significantly with seasons in general. The invasion of the Kuroshio is strongest in winter and is weakest in summer. The low salinity area in the vicinity of the Pearl River estuary is mainly affected by river runoff, and usually gets maximum impact in summer. In summary, the monthly variation of salinity has a strong correlation of the Kuroshio and the river diluted water. And these phenomena are consistent with actual measurements.

AB At present, digital content has permeated every part of human social life, and has become a valuable resource. However, while the vast amounts of information continue to occur, human beings are persecuted by the loss of information, especially those carrying human culture and civilization. The prolonged preservation technology of digital content faces enormous challenges. Therefore, the managers should consider how to supervise, manage and utilize the digital content for a long time by the scientific and reasonable measures. OAIS provides a conceptual model for the long-term preservation of digital content, it satisfy the basic need of the long-term preservation of digital content from the aspect of system function. But in the practice of preservation, the explicit data model is necessary, moreover, the model should meet the management need of whole life cycle in the long-term preservation of digital content, meanwhile it's necessary to choose the coding formats of media files. In this paper, firstly, we study the digital content management data model and propose a 7-layer reference model of digital content management according to the hierarchical idea. And then using data mining techniques, we implicit in all the associated data layer data extraction, comparison, analysis, and selectively format digital information for maintenance and preservation according to the appropriate standards. Finally, we process the corresponding data resources through data warehouse and online analytical. At the same time, establish the function of the system of internal links and with the external interface, and a series of high-level services on top of these interfaces.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Differential evolution (DE) is a new evolutionary optimization technique. It has shown good performance in many optimization problems. However, it easily falls into local minima in solving complex multimodal problems. In this paper, we propose an improved DE variant by employing hybrid strategies for solving multimodal problems. The proposed approach is called HDE, which utilizes opposition-based learning concept and optional external archive. Experiments on a multimodal benchmark set show that HDE achieves good solutions in many test cases. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID OPTIMIZATION
AB Differential Evolution (DE) is a recently proposed intelligent optimization algorithm, which has shown excellent search abilities in many real world and benchmark optimization problems. In order to enhance the performance of DE, this paper presents a hybrid DE algorithm, called HQDE, which employs a quantum-behaved mechanism and adaptive parameter control. To verify the performance of the proposed approach, ten well-known benchmark optimization problems were selected in the experiments. Simulation results demonstrate that HQDE obtains better performance than standard DE and another improved DE variant. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID TM DATA
AB Based on the same temporal remote sensing images of high resolution Landsat TM(ETM+), the land use and land cover change(LUCC) maps were acquired through visualization classification. Along with land use maps, two periods of LST(land surface temperature) were retrieved using method of atmospheric correction. To explain the influence of saltwater in coastal area, the study area was divided into three subregions of freshwater area, saltwater area, and transitional type water area according to corresponding salt water intrusion data over the past 20 years. The results showed that the area of culturing water and farmland increased significantly. At the same time, the area of beach and saline-alkali had a substantial reduction and the area of urban and rural settlements increased considerably. As the distance from the sea increasing (from saltwater area and transitional type water area to freshwater area), there was a decreasing trend in LST because of changes in vegetation cover and water surface area. With the influence of coastal economic development and salt water intrusion, the land use and land cover changed significantly, so did the land surface temperature. There was a decrease of LST in study area, the average LST was 30.72 degrees C in 1987 and 29.69 degrees C in 2000. The LST of 2000 reduced by 1.03 degrees C compared with that of 1987. Seawater intrusion significantly affected the spatial pattern of land cover and changes. LUCC was impacted evidently on the spatial distribution and changes of LST in the study area of Laizhou bay coastal areas. The change of LST is closely related to change of land use. This study would provide scientific reference and basis for decision making for ecological and environmental protection along coastal wetlands and beach land development.

AB In this paper a new SVM-based classification model is proposed by adding discriminative neighborhood preserving constraints. It obtains separating hyperplane from the combination of the support vector of the traditional SVM as well as the geometric and discriminant structure arise from the within-class and between-class neighborhood preserving matrices. These matrices characterize the two kinds of neighborhood geometric structures of data manifolds that are more helpful for obtaining consistent separating hyperplane than the isolated support vectors. The proposed model can be deduced to the generalized framework of SVM with some extra preprocessing for efficient and uniform computation, which makes it more attractive for real world applications. Experimental results on public data sets show that the proposed method has comparable or better generalization ability compared to some related SVMs algorithms. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper reviews state of the art of combined chilled ceilings and displacement ventilation (CC/DV) systems all over the world. The feasibility of the application of the combined systems in South-China area is analyzed. However, there exist three main problems such as panel surface condensation, first investment cost and enough cooling capacity to be solved. Several methods were illustrated to prevent the condensation of the combined systems in three aspects. The high investment cost problem can be solved with the development and production of new independent terminal products of CC systems. Many products can meet the cooling load requirements in most cases which are suitable for applying the combined CC/DV systems. Finally the development of combined systems in the South-China region in the future is prospected. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
